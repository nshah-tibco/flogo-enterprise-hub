Start all three apps (MCP, agents, orchestrator), then:   PG_PWD=<pwd> python _rebuild/chat_e2e.py
Optional: A2A_LOG=<file the agents app logs to> also proves the journal_match_agent really ran.
The DB is reset before and after. The LLM's wording varies run to run, so the hard assertions are on DB state;
text checks are loose. Writes the transcript to chat_e2e_transcript.md in the current folder."""
