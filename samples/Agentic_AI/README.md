## What Is the Agentic AI Connector?

The connector provides three primary building blocks. The **Flogo Features Used** column in the catalog below tells you which one (and which activities, triggers, and MCP/A2A features) each sample exercises.

| Building Block | Best For | Key Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM Client Activity** | Lightweight, stateless, one-shot LLM inference in a flow | Dynamic LLM config (provider, model, apiKey as inputs — no pre-configured connection), MCP tools, A2A remote agents, text or JSON response |
| **AI Agent Activity** | Embedding LLM intelligence inside an existing Flogo flow | LLM provider connection, model selection, default PII guardrails, token limits, MCP tools, in-memory conversation history, agent handoff |
| **AI Agent Trigger** | Building full-featured autonomous agents with custom logic | All AI Agent Activity features **plus** custom tools (Flogo flows), custom guardrails (prompt injection / advanced PII), custom conversation stores (DB, file, Redis), agent hand-off orchestration |

An **Invoke AI Agent Trigger Activity** (`callagent`) bridges the two worlds: it lets any Flogo trigger (REST, WebSocket, Kafka, Timer, …) deterministically dispatch a user prompt to an Agent Trigger and receive its response.

A fourth pattern in this folder — **Flogo as an MCP Tool Server** — turns a Flogo app into a Model Context Protocol server that exposes enterprise data and actions as tools that any MCP client (e.g. Claude Desktop) can call autonomously.

### Supported LLM Providers

**OpenAI** (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3) · **Gemini** (2.0 Flash, 2.5 Pro) · **Anthropic** (Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus) · **Ollama** (local: Llama 3, Mistral) · **vLLM** (self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

### Handler Types (Agent Trigger only)

| Handler Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Tool** | A Flogo flow the LLM can call as a tool. Receives `toolParams` and returns `response`. |
| **Custom Guardrail** | A Flogo flow invoked on every LLM input **and** output — advanced PII redaction, prompt-injection prevention, jailbreak detection, content policy. |
| **Custom Conversation Store** | Two Flogo flows — **STORE** (persist a message) and **FETCH** (retrieve all messages) — giving the agent durable, restartable memory backed by any store (DB, file, Redis, S3, …). |

New to the Agentic AI Connector? This path moves from the simplest building block to the most advanced, so each sample builds on the last:

1. **[Scheduled Reasoning Agent](./ScheduledReasoningAgent/)** — start with the **LLM Client Activity**: chained, stateless LLM calls driven by a timer and fed from an MCP server.
2. **[Insurance Claims Processor](./InsuranceClaimsProcessor/)** — chain LLM Client calls across an MCP server and an A2A agent to reach a decision.
3. **[IT Help Desk Advisor](./LLMClient-Dynamic-Config-And-Memory/)** — add multi-turn memory and dynamic MCP/A2A configuration to the LLM Client.
4. **[Dynamic Semantic Tool Selection at Scale](./DynamicSemanticToolSelectionAtScale/)** — combine an LLM Client selector with an AI Agent Activity to handle very large tool sets.
5. **[Morning Briefing](./morning-briefing/)** — move to the **AI Agent Activity** to summarize aggregated data inside a flow.

## Sample Details

### 1. [Insurance Claims Processor](./InsuranceClaimsProcessor/) — *Banking, Financial Services & Insurance*
A claims pipeline where a REST API chains two **LLM Client** calls: step 1 verifies policy coverage via an **MCP Server**, step 2 assesses fraud risk via an **A2A Server**, and the combined results yield an APPROVE/REVIEW/DENY recommendation. Three collaborating Flogo apps (orchestrator, policy MCP server, fraud A2A agent) with dynamic LLM config, PII redaction, and composite risk scoring.

### 2. [Mortgage AI Processor](./mortgagedemo/) — *Banking, Financial Services & Insurance*
An autonomous mortgage assessment system where Flogo acts as an **MCP tool server** exposing **10 tools** — read tools (applicant profile, credit score, valuation, debts, employment, DTI) and mutually-exclusive write tools (approve / escalate / decline + audit log). Claude Desktop conducts a full assessment in seconds, autonomously chaining tools. Includes a PostgreSQL schema with three pre-seeded scenarios (approve / escalate / decline) and mock REST backends.

### 3. [Healthcare Patient Support Agent](./Healthcare-Compliance-Agent/) — *Healthcare*
A HIPAA-aware patient support assistant built on the **AI Agent Trigger** with a **custom PHI guardrail** that redacts SSN, Date-of-Birth, and Medical Record Numbers from every LLM input and output, plus a **file-based custom conversation store** (STORE + FETCH) for persistent, auditable session history with HIPAA metadata on every turn. Three patient-service tools; compliance-first architecture.

### 4. [BeautyCo Retail Intelligence](./demo_retail/) — *Retail & Consumer*
An enterprise retail demo where Flogo acts as the **MCP tool server**, exposing the retailer's data as **12 AI-callable tools** (PostgreSQL + mock REST). Claude autonomously calls them to produce hyper-personalized beauty consultations, loyalty offers, and next-best-actions — all with data kept on-prem. Ships with seed data, a PostgreSQL schema, a mock API app, and a dashboard.

### 5. [Mobile Customer Care Multi-Agent Hub](./Mobile-Customer-Care-Multi-Agent/) — *Telecommunications & Customer Service*
A mobile carrier's support hub where one **AI Agent Activity** acts as an intelligent dispatcher over a configurable list of three specialist **AI Agent Triggers** (Billing, Technical Support, Upgrade Advisor). Demonstrates the "list of agents for handoff" feature, multi-hop handoff (Technical → Upgrade), and contrasts non-deterministic AI routing with deterministic `callagent` routing in the same app.

### 6. [Travel Itinerary Planner with A2A Server](./Travel-Itinerary-Planner/) — *Travel & Hospitality*
A conference travel coordinator demonstrating the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol**: a reusable **TravelPlannerAgent** (A2A Server) exposes flight/hotel/weather/itinerary tools, and an **EventTravelCoordinator** (Local Agent) adds event-specific intelligence (venue details, partner hotels, attendee registration) and delegates travel operations to the A2A Server via the `remoteAgents` list. Bridged to a REST trigger via `callagent`.

### 7. [Smart Supply Chain Assistant](./Smart-Supply-Chain-Assistant/) — *Manufacturing & Supply Chain*
A procurement assistant combining the **list of MCP servers** feature (one Agent Trigger connected to two running Flogo MCP servers at once) with a **custom `CreatePurchaseOrder` write tool**. The agent queries live inventory and supplier data via MCP, confirms details with the user, then creates purchase orders — all in one natural-language conversation invoked from a WebSocket trigger via `callagent`.

### 8. [AI-Powered Incident Triage Agent](./Ai-Triage-Agent/) — *IT Operations & Service Management*
An incident triage system that watches an integration error stream and cuts ServiceNow ticket noise ~90%. Each error is reasoned over by an **AI Agent Activity** using MCP tools: it decides new incident vs. duplicate (semantic, not string matching) vs. bad data, and for new incidents synthesizes a resolution recommendation from historical tickets. Includes a live browser dashboard with an error simulator; supports Ollama, OpenAI, and Azure OpenAI. Pre-built binaries included.

### 9. [IT Help Desk Advisor](./LLMClient-Dynamic-Config-And-Memory/) — *IT Operations & Service Management*
A multi-turn help desk advisor showcasing two Flogo 2.26.5 features: the **Memory Conversation Store** (history keyed by `conversationId`) and **dynamic MCP/A2A configuration** (`mcpServerConfigs` / `a2aServerConfigs` as activity inputs, no connection resource). An employee reports a WiFi issue, gets KB-guided steps across turns, and escalates to a ticket in one continuous conversation.

### 10. [Dynamic Semantic Tool Selection at Scale](./DynamicSemanticToolSelectionAtScale/) — *IT Operations & Service Management*
An IT Service Desk orchestrator handling requests across **150 tools** on three MCP servers via a two-step pattern: an **LLM Client** reads a text catalog and returns the relevant tool names, then an **AI Agent Activity** runs only those via `filteredToolNames`. A side-by-side comparison app shows the OpenAI 128-tool limit this pattern solves — scaling to hundreds or thousands of tools.

### 11. [Scheduled Reasoning Agent](./ScheduledReasoningAgent/) — *Cross-Industry / Workplace Productivity*
A timer-triggered agent (every Monday 8am) that queries a Sales Data MCP Server, generates a structured analysis, formats it into styled HTML via a third LLM call, saves it to disk, and emails stakeholders — zero human interaction. Three chained **LLM Client** calls with per-step temperatures (0.2 / 0.5 / 0.3), File Write, and Send Mail. A REST trigger is included for on-demand testing.

### 12. [Morning Briefing](./morning-briefing/) — *Cross-Industry / Workplace Productivity*
A workflow that aggregates data from four sources (Slack, email, calendar, reminders), sends it to Claude via an **AI Agent Activity**, and returns a prioritized markdown report in three tiers: 🔴 Needs Attention · 🟡 Important Today · 🟢 Awareness. Runs on a REST trigger or a 7am daily timer, with Docker-based mocks (Wiremock + MailHog) and guidance for swapping in real APIs (Slack, Outlook/Graph, Google Calendar, Todoist).

### 13. [Apartment Finder Agent](./Apartment-Finder-Agent/) — *Real Estate & Property Management*
A renter describes what they want in plain English and an **AI Agent Activity** chains eight tools on a **Flogo MCP Server** to answer it — resolving a place name to zip codes, shortlisting communities, then fanning out to rent, amenities, proximity and trailing-12-month crime data before ranking the options. The eighth tool, `schedule_visit`, **sends real email**: a `#mapper` `@conditional` step resolves the chosen `community_id` to its leasing office server-side, so the LLM can never redirect the confirmation, and `#sendmail` delivers it to the renter and the office at once. Prompt-level guardrails pin the agent to Texas apartment search and roll "Houston" up to its serviced suburbs.
