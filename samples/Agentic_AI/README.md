# TIBCO Flogo® Agentic AI — Samples & Industry Use Cases

This directory brings together two complementary collections for the **TIBCO Flogo® Agentic AI Connector** — the enterprise-grade way to build, orchestrate, and govern AI agents inside Flogo integration flows:

- **[Part 1 — Connector Feature Samples](#part-1--connector-feature-samples)** — focused apps that each teach a building block: **LLM Client Activity**, **AI Agent Activity**, **AI Agent Trigger**, custom guardrails, custom conversation stores, the "Flogo as an MCP tool server" pattern, and the **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent) protocol. Start here to learn *how* the connector works.
- **[Part 2 — Industry Use-Case Demos](#part-2--industry-use-case-demos)** — complete, PostgreSQL-backed, vertical-specific demos (banking, insurance, healthcare, telecom, utilities, aerospace, manufacturing, retail, real estate, and more). Each applies the same repeatable **three-app pattern** — an **MCP Server** (read-only tools), an **A2A Agents** app (guarded write workflows), and a **WebSocket AI Orchestrator** (the conversational brain). Start here to see *what* you can build.

New here? Skim **[What Is the Agentic AI Connector?](#what-is-the-agentic-ai-connector)**, then follow the feature-sample **[Suggested Learning Order](#suggested-learning-order)** or jump straight to an **[industry use case](#use-case-catalog)**. Both collections share the **[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)**, **[Quick Start](#quick-start)**, and the browser **[Flogo Chatbot](#flogo-chatbot--browser-based-websocket-test-client)** test client.

## What Is the Agentic AI Connector?

The connector provides three primary building blocks. The **Flogo Features Used** column in the feature-sample catalog below tells you which one (and which activities, triggers, and MCP/A2A features) each sample exercises.

| Building Block | Best For | Key Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM Client Activity** | Lightweight, stateless, one-shot LLM inference in a flow | Dynamic LLM config (provider, model, apiKey as inputs — no pre-configured connection), MCP tools, A2A remote agents, text or JSON response |
| **AI Agent Activity** | Embedding LLM intelligence inside an existing Flogo flow | LLM provider connection, model selection, default PII guardrails, token limits, MCP tools, in-memory conversation history, agent handoff |
| **AI Agent Trigger** | Building full-featured autonomous agents with custom logic | All AI Agent Activity features **plus** custom tools (Flogo flows), custom guardrails (prompt injection / advanced PII), custom conversation stores (DB, file, Redis), agent hand-off orchestration |

An **Invoke AI Agent Trigger Activity** (`callagent`) bridges the two worlds: it lets any Flogo trigger (REST, WebSocket, Kafka, Timer, …) deterministically dispatch a user prompt to an Agent Trigger and receive its response.

A fourth pattern in this folder — **Flogo as an MCP Tool Server** — turns a Flogo app into a Model Context Protocol server that exposes enterprise data and actions as tools that any MCP client (e.g. Claude Desktop) can call autonomously.

### Supported LLM Providers

**OpenAI** (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3) · **Gemini** (2.0 Flash, 2.5 Pro) · **Anthropic** (Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus) · **Ollama** (local: Llama 3, Mistral) · **vLLM** (self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

### Handler Types (Agent Trigger only)

| Handler Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Tool** | A Flogo flow the LLM can call as a tool. Receives `toolParams` and returns `response`. |
| **Custom Guardrail** | A Flogo flow invoked on every LLM input **and** output — advanced PII redaction, prompt-injection prevention, jailbreak detection, content policy. |
| **Custom Conversation Store** | Two Flogo flows — **STORE** (persist a message) and **FETCH** (retrieve all messages) — giving the agent durable, restartable memory backed by any store (DB, file, Redis, S3, …). |

## Suggested Learning Order

New to the Agentic AI Connector? This path moves from the simplest building block to the most advanced, so each sample builds on the last:

1. **[Scheduled Reasoning Agent](./ScheduledReasoningAgent/)** — start with the **LLM Client Activity**: chained, stateless LLM calls driven by a timer and fed from an MCP server.
2. **[Insurance Claims Processor](./InsuranceClaimsProcessor/)** — chain LLM Client calls across an MCP server and an A2A agent to reach a decision.
3. **[IT Help Desk Advisor](./LLMClient-Dynamic-Config-And-Memory/)** — add multi-turn memory and dynamic MCP/A2A configuration to the LLM Client.
4. **[Dynamic Semantic Tool Selection at Scale](./DynamicSemanticToolSelectionAtScale/)** — combine an LLM Client selector with an AI Agent Activity to handle very large tool sets.
5. **[Morning Briefing](./morning-briefing/)** — move to the **AI Agent Activity** to summarize aggregated data inside a flow.
6. **[AI-Powered Incident Triage Agent](./Ai-Triage-Agent/)** — give the AI Agent Activity MCP tools and reasoning to deduplicate incidents.
7. **[Mobile Customer Care Multi-Agent Hub](./Mobile-Customer-Care-Multi-Agent/)** — use the AI Agent Activity as a dispatcher with multi-agent handoff.
8. **[Healthcare Patient Support Agent](./Healthcare-Compliance-Agent/)** — build a full **AI Agent Trigger** with a custom guardrail and custom conversation store.
9. **[Smart Supply Chain Assistant](./Smart-Supply-Chain-Assistant/)** — connect an Agent Trigger to multiple MCP servers plus a custom write tool.
10. **[Travel Itinerary Planner with A2A Server](./Travel-Itinerary-Planner/)** — orchestrate agents across apps with the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.
11. **[BeautyCo Retail Intelligence](./demo_retail/)** — turn Flogo into an **MCP tool server** that external AI clients (e.g. Claude Desktop) can call.
12. **[Mortgage AI Processor](./mortgagedemo/)** — apply the MCP-server pattern to autonomous, auditable decisioning.
13. **[Apartment Finder Agent](./Apartment-Finder-Agent/)** — put both halves together: an AI Agent Activity chats over your own MCP tool server, and one of those tools sends real email.

## Sample Details

### 1. [Insurance Claims Processor](./InsuranceClaimsProcessor/) — *Banking, Financial Services & Insurance*
A claims pipeline where a REST API chains two **LLM Client** calls: step 1 verifies policy coverage via an **MCP Server**, step 2 assesses fraud risk via an **A2A Server**, and the combined results yield an APPROVE/REVIEW/DENY recommendation. Three collaborating Flogo apps (orchestrator, policy MCP server, fraud A2A agent) with dynamic LLM config, PII redaction, and composite risk scoring.

### 2. [Mortgage AI Processor](./mortgagedemo/) — *Banking, Financial Services & Insurance*
An autonomous mortgage assessment system where Flogo acts as an **MCP tool server** exposing **10 tools** — read tools (applicant profile, credit score, valuation, debts, employment, DTI) and mutually-exclusive write tools (approve / escalate / decline + audit log). Claude Desktop conducts a full assessment in seconds, autonomously chaining tools. Includes a PostgreSQL schema with three pre-seeded scenarios (approve / escalate / decline) and mock REST backends.

### 3. [Healthcare Patient Support Agent](./Healthcare-Compliance-Agent/) — *Healthcare*
A HIPAA-aware patient support assistant built on the **AI Agent Trigger** with a **custom PHI guardrail** that redacts SSN, Date-of-Birth, and Medical Record Numbers from every LLM input and output, plus a **file-based custom conversation store** (STORE + FETCH) for persistent, auditable session history with HIPAA metadata on every turn. Three patient-service tools; compliance-first architecture.

### 4. [BeautyCo Retail Intelligence](./demo_retail/) — *Retail & Consumer*
An enterprise retail demo where Flogo acts as the **MCP tool server**, exposing the retailer's data as **12 AI-callable tools** (PostgreSQL + mock REST). Claude autonomously calls them to produce hyper-personalized beauty consultations, loyalty offers, and next-best-actions — all with data kept on-prem. Ships with seed data, a PostgreSQL schema, a mock API app, and a dashboard.

### 5. [Mobile Customer Care Multi-Agent Hub](./Mobile-Customer-Care-Multi-Agent/) — *Telecommunications & Customer Service*
A mobile carrier's support hub where one **AI Agent Activity** acts as an intelligent dispatcher over a configurable list of three specialist **AI Agent Triggers** (Billing, Technical Support, Upgrade Advisor). Demonstrates the "list of agents for handoff" feature, multi-hop handoff (Technical → Upgrade), and contrasts non-deterministic AI routing with deterministic `callagent` routing in the same app.

### 6. [Travel Itinerary Planner with A2A Server](./Travel-Itinerary-Planner/) — *Travel & Hospitality*
A conference travel coordinator demonstrating the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol**: a reusable **TravelPlannerAgent** (A2A Server) exposes flight/hotel/weather/itinerary tools, and an **EventTravelCoordinator** (Local Agent) adds event-specific intelligence (venue details, partner hotels, attendee registration) and delegates travel operations to the A2A Server via the `remoteAgents` list. Bridged to a REST trigger via `callagent`.

### 7. [Smart Supply Chain Assistant](./Smart-Supply-Chain-Assistant/) — *Manufacturing & Supply Chain*
A procurement assistant combining the **list of MCP servers** feature (one Agent Trigger connected to two running Flogo MCP servers at once) with a **custom `CreatePurchaseOrder` write tool**. The agent queries live inventory and supplier data via MCP, confirms details with the user, then creates purchase orders — all in one natural-language conversation invoked from a WebSocket trigger via `callagent`.

### 8. [AI-Powered Incident Triage Agent](./Ai-Triage-Agent/) — *IT Operations & Service Management*
An incident triage system that watches an integration error stream and cuts ServiceNow ticket noise ~90%. Each error is reasoned over by an **AI Agent Activity** using MCP tools: it decides new incident vs. duplicate (semantic, not string matching) vs. bad data, and for new incidents synthesizes a resolution recommendation from historical tickets. Includes a live browser dashboard with an error simulator; supports Ollama, OpenAI, and Azure OpenAI. Pre-built binaries included.

### 9. [IT Help Desk Advisor](./LLMClient-Dynamic-Config-And-Memory/) — *IT Operations & Service Management*
A multi-turn help desk advisor showcasing two Flogo 2.26.5 features: the **Memory Conversation Store** (history keyed by `conversationId`) and **dynamic MCP/A2A configuration** (`mcpServerConfigs` / `a2aServerConfigs` as activity inputs, no connection resource). An employee reports a WiFi issue, gets KB-guided steps across turns, and escalates to a ticket in one continuous conversation.

### 10. [Dynamic Semantic Tool Selection at Scale](./DynamicSemanticToolSelectionAtScale/) — *IT Operations & Service Management*
An IT Service Desk orchestrator handling requests across **150 tools** on three MCP servers via a two-step pattern: an **LLM Client** reads a text catalog and returns the relevant tool names, then an **AI Agent Activity** runs only those via `filteredToolNames`. A side-by-side comparison app shows the OpenAI 128-tool limit this pattern solves — scaling to hundreds or thousands of tools.

### 11. [Scheduled Reasoning Agent](./ScheduledReasoningAgent/) — *Cross-Industry / Workplace Productivity*
A timer-triggered agent (every Monday 8am) that queries a Sales Data MCP Server, generates a structured analysis, formats it into styled HTML via a third LLM call, saves it to disk, and emails stakeholders — zero human interaction. Three chained **LLM Client** calls with per-step temperatures (0.2 / 0.5 / 0.3), File Write, and Send Mail. A REST trigger is included for on-demand testing.

### 12. [Morning Briefing](./morning-briefing/) — *Cross-Industry / Workplace Productivity*
A workflow that aggregates data from four sources (Slack, email, calendar, reminders), sends it to Claude via an **AI Agent Activity**, and returns a prioritized markdown report in three tiers: 🔴 Needs Attention · 🟡 Important Today · 🟢 Awareness. Runs on a REST trigger or a 7am daily timer, with Docker-based mocks (Wiremock + MailHog) and guidance for swapping in real APIs (Slack, Outlook/Graph, Google Calendar, Todoist).

### 13. [Apartment Finder Agent](./Apartment-Finder-Agent/) — *Real Estate & Property Management*
A renter describes what they want in plain English and an **AI Agent Activity** chains eight tools on a **Flogo MCP Server** to answer it — resolving a place name to zip codes, shortlisting communities, then fanning out to rent, amenities, proximity and trailing-12-month crime data before ranking the options. The eighth tool, `schedule_visit`, **sends real email**: a `#mapper` `@conditional` step resolves the chosen `community_id` to its leasing office server-side, so the LLM can never redirect the confirmation, and `#sendmail` delivers it to the renter and the office at once. Prompt-level guardrails pin the agent to Texas apartment search and roll "Houston" up to its serviced suburbs.

# Part 2 — Industry Use-Case Demos

End-to-end, **industry-specific Agentic AI demos** built on **TIBCO Flogo® Enterprise**. Where Part 1 isolates individual features, these use cases assemble them into complete, PostgreSQL-backed business scenarios — the same reusable pattern applied to a different vertical each time.

## The Three-App Pattern

Most use cases here ship the same **standard trio** of Flogo apps plus a PostgreSQL database. Understand it once and every use case reads the same way:

| App | Role | Trigger | Talks to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`*MCPServer.flogo`** | Exposes **read-only** business data as MCP tools (query customers, policies, invoices, tickets…). Returns all rows; the orchestrator filters. | HTTP (streamable MCP) | PostgreSQL |
| **`*A2AServers.flogo`** *(a.k.a. `*Agents.flogo`)* | One **A2A agent per guarded write action** (open a ticket, submit a claim, schedule a visit, send email…). Each agent runs on its own port. | A2A server (one port each) | PostgreSQL / SMTP |
| **`*AIOrchestrator.flogo`** | The **conversational brain**: classifies intent, calls MCP read tools, hands off to A2A write agents, and enforces confirm-before-write guardrails. | WebSocket (`wsserver`) | LLM · MCP · A2A |

```
   Browser Chatbot  ──ws──▶  AI Orchestrator  ──▶  LLM (OpenAI / Gemini / Anthropic)
                                   │  ├──▶ MCP Server   ──▶ PostgreSQL   (reads)
                                   │  └──▶ A2A Agents   ──▶ PostgreSQL / SMTP  (guarded writes)
```

> **Naming:** the write-tier app is the **A2A Agents** app. The current samples name its file `*A2AServers.flogo`; newer apps and the build skills name it `*Agents.flogo` — **same app, either name**.

A few use cases deliberately vary this shape — see the **Variant** badge in the [status legend](#status-legend). BusinessWorks (BW6) and REST-tier variants ship their own detailed READMEs.

Port `:9095` recurs across Aerospace (MCP), Predictive Maintenance (REST), and Hospital. Change a port in the app properties to run overlapping demos simultaneously.

---

## Prerequisites

**Every sample and use case needs:**

- **TIBCO Flogo® 2.26.4 or later** (2.26.5+ for the [IT Help Desk Advisor](./LLMClient-Dynamic-Config-And-Memory/) memory / dynamic-config sample), with the [Flogo VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tibco.flogo). See the [Agentic AI documentation](https://docs.tibco.com/pub/flogo/latest/doc/html/Default.htm#connectors/agentic-AI/agentic-AI-overview.htm).
- An **API key** for your chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, Gemini, or Anthropic). Where a base URL is used, point it at a **real endpoint** (e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1`). The default model referenced in the Part 2 demos is `gpt-5.6`; substitute any model your account can access.
- A **WebSocket client** for testing WebSocket samples/use cases: the included [Flogo Chatbot](#flogo-chatbot--browser-based-websocket-test-client) (Node.js 16+) or [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat).

**The Part 2 industry use cases additionally need:**

- **PostgreSQL 14+** (local or remote) — each use case creates its own database (`database.sql` + `reset_data.sql`).

**Some samples/use cases have extra prerequisites** — check the catalogs and each folder's README:

- **🔍 RAG** ([Auto Insurance](./Auto_Insurance_Assistant_Use_Case/)): a document set + vector store; it ingests policy PDFs.
- **🏛️ BW6** ([Retail — BW & Flogo](./Retail_AI_BW_Flogo/)): **TIBCO BusinessWorks 6.12** and Node.js for the MCP proxy.
- **SMTP** (Life & Pensions, Telecom, Power Distribution and others with an email agent): an SMTP account — e.g. Gmail with an App Password over SSL (port 465).
- **PostgreSQL / Docker / Claude Desktop** for several Part 1 samples (Mortgage AI, BeautyCo Retail, Morning Briefing) — see each sample's README.

> **Credentials are not shipped.** Every app property that held a secret is reset to a placeholder (`SECRET:YOURKEY` for connection API keys). Set your own LLM key, PostgreSQL password, and SMTP credentials before running — see each folder's README / manual-steps section.

3. Navigate to `samples/Agentic_AI/<sample-name>/` and open the `.flogo` file.
4. Configure your LLM Provider connection with your API key.
5. Run the app from VS Code and connect via the [Flogo Chatbot](#flogo-chatbot--browser-based-websocket-test-client), websocat, or a REST client — see the sample's README for the exact endpoint and port.

### Part 2 — an industry use case (standard trio)

The steps are identical for each ✅ use case; only the database name, ports, and WebSocket path change (see the [catalog](#use-case-catalog)). Example uses Life & Pensions:

**1. Create and load the database:**

```bash
cd samples/Agentic_AI/Life_And_Pensions_Use_Case
createdb life_pensions                          # or: psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE life_pensions;"
psql -U postgres -d life_pensions -f database.sql
psql -U postgres -d life_pensions -f reset_data.sql   # optional: refresh demo dates relative to today
```

**2. Import the three apps** into Flogo Enterprise (VS Code Flogo extension): the `*MCPServer.flogo`, `*A2AServers.flogo` (a.k.a. `*Agents.flogo`), and `*AIOrchestrator.flogo` for that use case.

**3. Set the app properties** — PostgreSQL host/port/database/user/password, your **LLM API key** and model, ports, and (if the use case has an email agent) SMTP settings. The exact property names are in each folder's README / manual-steps section.

**4. Start the apps in order** (the orchestrator needs the others running first):

```
1) *MCPServer               → HTTP MCP port ready first
2) *A2AServers / *Agents    → all A2A agent ports
3) *AIOrchestrator          → WebSocket port (needs MCP + A2A up)
```

**5. Connect the Chatbot** and start chatting:

```bash
cd samples/Agentic_AI/Chatbot
npm install
npm start                 # http://localhost:3000
# In the UI, set the WebSocket URL for your use case and click Connect, e.g.:
#   ws://localhost:9600/lifepensions
```

**6. Run the demo** using the prompts in that use case's `prompts.md`. After a run that performed writes, re-run `reset_data.sql` to restore the seeded data.

> 🏛️ **BW6** and 📦 **prebuilt-binary** use cases start differently (TIBCO Business Studio / running the `.exe` directly) — follow their own READMEs.

### Flogo Chatbot — Browser-Based WebSocket Test Client

A ready-to-use, domain-agnostic chat UI in [`Chatbot/`](./Chatbot/) drives any sample or use case that exposes a WebSocket endpoint. It supports multiple concurrent sessions, an editable WebSocket URL, and a live connection indicator.

```bash
cd samples/Agentic_AI/Chatbot
npm install
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000, set the WebSocket URL for your sample/use case
# (ws://localhost:<port><path>), and click Connect.
```

See each folder's individual `README.md` for detailed configuration and usage instructions.
