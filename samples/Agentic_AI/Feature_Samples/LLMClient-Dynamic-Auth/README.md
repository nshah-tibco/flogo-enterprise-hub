# LLM Client Dynamic Auth — Authenticated MCP and A2A Servers Injected at Runtime

*Use case: a Pharmacovigilance Safety Intake Advisor.*

## Overview

**Nothing in the `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` orchestrator is configured through a connection resource.** Its LLM provider, both backend URLs, both auth types and both bearer tokens are activity **inputs** resolved from App Properties — so the same flow runs against dev, staging and production, and rotating a credential never touches a flow.

> `RegulatoryReportingA2A.flogo` deliberately makes the opposite choice: its Agent Trigger *does* use an `#llmprovider` connection resource. That contrast is intentional — see [Dynamic LLM Provider Configuration](#dynamic-llm-provider-configuration) for both styles side by side.

It is the companion to the [IT Help Desk Advisor](../LLMClient-Dynamic-Config-And-Memory/), which shows dynamic MCP/A2A config with `authType: "None"`. This sample answers the question that one leaves open: *what does the same pattern look like when the backends actually require credentials?*

Three things are injected into a single **LLM Client Activity** at runtime:

1. **The LLM provider** — `llmConfiguration` supplies provider, model, API key and base URL as a mapping. Swap OpenAI for Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama or vLLM by editing properties; no LLM connection resource exists in the orchestrator.
2. **A token-protected MCP Server** — `authType: "Token"` on the client, `API Key` bearer validation on the server. Read-only safety reference data.
3. **A token-protected A2A Server** — `authType: "Static Token"` on both the client and the agent trigger. Guarded writes to the safety database and health-authority gateways.

Plus a **Memory Conversation Store** so a drug safety associate can work one case across many turns without re-stating it.

Three independent Flogo applications work together:

- **DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo** — A **WebSocket server** whose LLM Client Activity triages an adverse event and carries a bearer token to each backend.
- **SafetySignalMCPServer.flogo** — An **authenticated MCP Server** exposing product labeling, prior case history, and expectedness checks.
- **RegulatoryReportingA2A.flogo** — An **authenticated A2A Server** that opens Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) and files E2B(R3) expedited reports.

| Pattern | Component | What It Shows |
|---|---|---|
| **Dynamic LLM configuration** | `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` | `llmConfiguration` mapping supplies `provider`, `model`, `apiKey` and `providerBaseUrl` from App Properties — this app has **no LLM provider connection resource** |
| **Authenticated MCP (client)** | `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` | `mcpServerConfigs` with `authType: "Token"` + property-resolved `authToken` |
| **Authenticated MCP (server)** | `SafetySignalMCPServer.flogo` | MCP Server trigger with `authType: "API Key"` + `authToken`, per-tool `scope` values |
| **Authenticated A2A (client)** | `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` | `a2aServerConfigs` with `authType: "Static Token"` + property-resolved `authToken` |
| **Authenticated A2A (server)** | `RegulatoryReportingA2A.flogo` | Agent Trigger with `agentAuthMode: "Static Token"` + `agentToken` |
| **Memory Conversation Store** | `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` | `conversationStoreType: "Memory"` + `memoryMaxSize: 24` + `conversationId` from query param |
| **Dynamic backend config** | `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` | Every field of both server configs — name, URL, auth type and token — resolved from App Properties |

### How This Differs from the IT Help Desk Advisor Sample

| Aspect | IT Help Desk Advisor | This Sample |
|---|---|---|
| MCP `authType` (client) | `None` | `Token` |
| MCP `authType` (server trigger) | `None` | `API Key` (switchable to `JWT Token`) |
| A2A `authType` (client) | `None` | `Static Token` |
| A2A `agentAuthMode` (server trigger) | `None` | `Static Token` |
| Per-tool MCP `scope` | not set | `product:read` / `cases:read` / `labeling:read` |
| Vertical | IT Operations | Pharmaceutical & Life Sciences |
| Consequence of a wrong answer | A reopened ticket | A missed regulatory deadline |

## Real-World Scenario

**Persona**: Dana, a drug safety associate at Northwind Therapeutics, receives a phone call from an investigator site running the Phase III study **VEL-301** for **Velcaridine** (IMP-4471), an anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. A subject has been hospitalised with liver failure.

Dana has to answer one question fast: **is this a SUSAR?** Under ICH E2A, a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction is a case that is *serious*, *unexpected* against the Reference Safety Information, and has *at least a reasonable possibility of causal relationship*. If it is, the sponsor has **15 calendar days** to file with health authorities — **7 days** if the event is fatal or life-threatening. The clock starts the moment the sponsor receives the four minimum criteria.

```
Connect via WebSocket:
  ws://localhost:9220/drugsafety?caseId=VEL-301-0442

Turn 1 — Dana reports the call:
  > Site 0044 just called. Subject VEL-301-0442 on IMP-4471 was hospitalised
  > yesterday with acute hepatic failure. Investigator says probable causality.

  System:
    [Calls lookup_investigational_product → SafetySignalMCPServer, Bearer token]
    [Calls check_label_expectedness    → SafetySignalMCPServer, Bearer token]

    "Confirmed: IMP-4471 (Velcaridine), protocol VEL-301, Phase III.
     The Reference Safety Information in force is Investigator's Brochure v6.0
     (effective 2026-02-01).

     Hepatic failure is UNEXPECTED (not listed). Section 6.3 lists only
     asymptomatic transaminase elevation, which is not of the same nature
     or severity.

     Triage so far:
       Serious       — yes, hospitalisation
       Unexpected    — yes, unlisted against IB v6.0
       Causality     — probable, per the investigator

     That is all three ICH E2A criteria, so this is a SUSAR on a 15-day clock.
     Before I open the case, do you have all four minimum criteria — an
     identifiable patient, an identifiable reporter, the suspect product,
     and the suspect reaction?"

Turn 2 — Dana confirms (same caseId = conversation memory kicks in):
  > Yes, all four. Anything else we already know about hepatic events on this product?

  System (remembers the product and term — does NOT re-ask):
    [Calls search_case_history → SafetySignalMCPServer, Bearer token]

    "Three prior hepatic cases across 1,240 exposed subjects: ICSR-2026-00874 (DE),
     ICSR-2026-01133 (US), and ICSR-2026-01402 (JP, life-threatening). All three
     had positive dechallenge. Observed rate 2.42 per 1,000 against a background
     rate of 0.14 — roughly 17-fold.

     A signal is already open: SIG-2026-0033, with the Hepatology Signal Team
     since 2026-04-11. This case should go to them in parallel with the
     expedited report.

     Shall I open the ICSR now? I'll record: IMP-4471, hepatic failure,
     serious (hospitalisation), unexpected, probable causality,
     subject reference VEL-301-0442."

Turn 3 — Dana approves the write:
  > Yes, open it and file with FDA.

  System (remembers all triage facts from Turns 1 and 2):
    [Calls create_safety_case        → RegulatoryReportingA2A, Static Token]
    [Calls submit_expedited_report   → RegulatoryReportingA2A, Static Token]
                                       destination: "FDA"

    "Case ICSR-2026-01588 created and classified as a SUSAR.
     Clock started 2026-09-25, due 2026-10-10 (15 calendar days).
     Assigned to Dr. Priya Raman, Medical Safety Physician.
     Signal team notified under SIG-2026-0033.

     Expedited E2B(R3) report filed with FDA — submission SUB-2026-FDA-004417,
     acknowledgement AA, authority case FAERS-29104778.

     Submitted 15 days ahead of the deadline. EudraVigilance has not been
     filed yet — say the word and I'll submit to EMA as well."

Turn 4 — Dana asks for the second agency:
  > Yes, file with EMA too.

  System:
    [Calls submit_expedited_report   → RegulatoryReportingA2A, Static Token]
                                       destination: "EMA"

    "Filed with EMA EudraVigilance — submission SUB-2026-EMA-004418,
     acknowledgement AA, authority case EV-2026-DE-0088431. BfArM was
     notified through the EudraVigilance re-routing rules."
```

**Same `caseId` across all turns.** The advisor never re-asks the product, the reaction term, or the causality assessment — and it never writes to the safety database without Dana's explicit confirmation.

## Files in This Sample

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` | **Orchestrator** — WebSocket server on port 9220. LLM Client Activity with a Memory Conversation Store (`memoryMaxSize: 24`) and `mcpServerConfigs` / `a2aServerConfigs` injected as inputs, both carrying bearer tokens from App Properties. |
| `SafetySignalMCPServer.flogo` | **Authenticated MCP Server** — Stateless MCP Server on port 9221 with `authType: "API Key"`. Three read-only tools with per-tool `scope` values, backed by mock pharmacovigilance data. |
| `RegulatoryReportingA2A.flogo` | **Authenticated A2A Server** — Regulatory reporting agent on port 9222 with `agentAuthMode: "Static Token"`. Three write/lookup tools with mock ICSR and E2B(R3) submission data. |

## Dynamic LLM Provider Configuration

The LLM Client Activity can take its provider either from a **connection resource** (designed once, fixed at build time) or from the **`llmConfiguration` input** (resolved per execution). `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` uses the input form exclusively — open that app and you will find no LLM provider connection at all.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "llmConfiguration": {
      "mapping": {
        "provider": "=$property[\"LLMClient.LLM_Provider\"]",
        "apiKey": "=$property[\"LLMClient.API_Key\"]",
        "model": "=$property[\"LLMClient.LLM_Model\"]",
        "providerBaseUrl": "=$property[\"LLMClient.LLM_Base_URL\"]",
        "temperature": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | `LLMClient.LLM_Provider` | `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `Gemini`, `Ollama`, `vLLM`, … |
| `apiKey` | `LLMClient.API_Key` | Shipped as an encrypted `SECRET:...` property; retype it in the editor to set your own key |
| `model` | `LLMClient.LLM_Model` | Defaults to `gpt-5-nano` |
| `providerBaseUrl` | `LLMClient.LLM_Base_URL` | Empty by default, which means "use the provider's own endpoint". Set it for self-hosted (Ollama, vLLM) or gateway endpoints |
| `temperature` | literal `0` | Zero on purpose — regulatory triage rewards consistency over creativity |

**Why it matters here.** Case narratives can contain patient data, and which model is allowed to see them is a deployment decision, not a design decision. Because the provider, model and endpoint are three App Properties (`LLMClient.LLM_Provider`, `LLMClient.LLM_Model`, `LLMClient.LLM_Base_URL`) rather than a designed-in connection, retargeting the LLM is a property change against an unchanged flow — the same lever that lets one artifact promote from dev to validated production. As shipped:

```
LLMClient.LLM_Provider = OpenAI
LLMClient.LLM_Model    = gpt-5-nano
LLMClient.LLM_Base_URL =              # empty - use OpenAI's own endpoint
```

`RegulatoryReportingA2A.flogo` deliberately makes the **opposite** choice: its Agent Trigger uses an `#llmprovider` connection resource. Between the two apps you can see both styles side by side.

---

## Authentication — How It Works

Auth in this sample is **symmetric**: each server validates a bearer token, and the LLM Client Activity presents that token as part of the config it injects at runtime. Because both halves read from App Properties, rotating a credential is a property change on two apps — no flow edits.

### The Two Hops

| Hop | Client side (`DrugSafetyAdvisor`) | Server side | HTTP header sent |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MCP** | `mcpServerConfigs[].authType = "Token"` | `authType = "API Key"` on the MCP Server trigger | `Authorization: Bearer <FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TOKEN>` |
| **A2A** | `a2aServerConfigs[].authType = "Static Token"` | `agentAuthMode = "Static Token"` on the Agent trigger | `Authorization: Bearer <A2A.AuthToken>` |

> **Why the names differ.** The two connectors use different vocabulary for the same bearer-token exchange. On the LLM Client the MCP option is called **`Token`**; the MCP Server trigger calls the matching mode **`API Key`**. For A2A both sides agree on **`Static Token`**. These are the only non-`None` values the LLM Client's injected configs accept — the full enums are `["None", "Token"]` for MCP and `["None", "Static Token"]` for A2A.

### MCP Server — `API Key`

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "serverName": "SafetySignalMCPServer",
    "serverPort": "=$property[\"FlogoMcpServer.PORT\"]",
    "serverEndpointPath": "/mcp",
    "authType": "=$property[\"FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TYPE\"]",
    "authToken": "=$property[\"FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TOKEN\"]"
  }
}
```

The server compares the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header against `authToken`. A missing or wrong token gets **HTTP 401** before any flow runs.

### LLM Client — injecting the MCP token

```json
{
  "input": {
    "mcpServerConfigs": {
      "mapping": [
        {
          "name": "=$property[\"LLMClient.MCP.Safety.Server_Name\"]",
          "serverType": "http",
          "serverUrl": "=$property[\"LLMClient.MCP.Safety.Server_URL\"]",
          "httpTransportType": "streamable",
          "authType": "=$property[\"LLMClient.MCP.Safety.Auth_Type\"]",
          "authToken": "=$property[\"LLMClient.MCP.Safety.Auth_Token\"]"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### A2A Server — `Static Token`

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "agentType": "A2A Server",
    "agentPort": "=$property[\"A2A.port\"]",
    "agentUrl": "=$property[\"A2A.AgentUrl\"]",
    "agentAuthMode": "=$property[\"A2A.AuthMode\"]",
    "agentToken": "=$property[\"A2A.AuthToken\"]"
  }
}
```

### LLM Client — injecting the A2A token

```json
{
  "input": {
    "a2aServerConfigs": {
      "mapping": [
        {
          "name": "=$property[\"LLMClient.A2A.Regulatory.Server_Name\"]",
          "serverUrl": "=$property[\"LLMClient.A2A.Regulatory.Server_URL\"]",
          "authType": "=$property[\"LLMClient.A2A.Regulatory.Auth_Type\"]",
          "authToken": "=$property[\"LLMClient.A2A.Regulatory.Auth_Token\"]"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Upgrading the MCP Server to JWT with Scopes

Each MCP tool already carries a `scope` value, so scope enforcement is one property away:

| Tool | Scope |
|---|---|
| `lookup_investigational_product` | `product:read` |
| `search_case_history` | `cases:read` |
| `check_label_expectedness` | `labeling:read` |

In `API Key` mode these `scope` values are **ignored** — any caller with the right token reaches every tool. Set `FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TYPE` to `JWT Token`, put the HMAC signing secret in `FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TOKEN`, and put a signed JWT carrying the required scopes in `LLMClient.MCP.Safety.Auth_Token`; the server then rejects per tool and populates `tokenInfo` for the flows. See [Patient Records with Scoped Access (JWT)](../../../Model_Context_Protocol\(MCP\)/MCP_JWT_Scope_Access_Control/) for a worked example, and the [MCP Server Security Guide](../../../Model_Context_Protocol\(MCP\)/MCP_Server_Authentication/) for all four auth types.

> **Every token and API key in this sample is stored as an encrypted `SECRET:...` app property.** Flogo encrypts them with its built-in default key, so the apps still run as shipped — the plaintext values are printed below only so you can reproduce the `curl` calls. What the `SECRET:` prefix buys you is that the value is masked in the editor and that the App Properties block holds ciphertext instead of a token. It is obfuscation against a casual reader, not protection: the key is built into the tooling, so anyone holding Flogo can decrypt it. For a real deployment, inject the values from your platform's secret store instead, and put TLS in front of both servers — a bearer token on plain HTTP is only as private as the network. The MCP Server terminates TLS itself; the A2A Agent Trigger has no TLS settings, so it needs ingress or a reverse proxy in front of it. See [What to Customize](#what-to-customize) for both.
>
> **Encrypting an app property does not sweep the token out of the whole file.** Design-time sample data lives alongside the runtime mapping — in this app, `mcpServerConfigs` and `a2aServerConfigs` each carry an `fe_metadata` blob that the editor uses to preview the array mapper, and a token pasted there stays in cleartext no matter how the property is stored. Those two blobs now hold a `<resolved at runtime from ...>` placeholder rather than the real bearer tokens. If you build a similar app, grep the finished `.flogo` for your token before committing; the runtime mapping being `=$property[...]` is not on its own evidence that the file is clean.

> **The WebSocket entry point is unauthenticated, and that is the sample's weakest point.** The `#wsserver` trigger ships with `enableTLS: false` and `enableClientAuth: false`, so anything that can reach port 9220 gets served — using *this app's* LLM API key and *this app's* bearer tokens for both downstream hops. Authenticating the MCP and A2A calls protects those backends from unauthorized *services*; it does nothing to establish who the end user is. Locally that is fine, and it keeps the sample runnable without certificate setup. Anywhere else, put authenticated ingress in front of port 9220 (or enable TLS plus client auth on the trigger) and derive `caseId` from the authenticated principal rather than trusting a query parameter — otherwise any caller can name any case and read its history back out of the conversation store.

---

## Memory Conversation Store

`conversationStoreType: "Memory"` with `memoryMaxSize: 24` gives the LLM Client multi-turn memory keyed on `conversationId`, which this sample maps from the `caseId` query parameter:

```json
{
  "settings": { "conversationStoreType": "Memory", "memoryMaxSize": 24 },
  "input":    { "conversationId": "=coerce.toString($flow.queryParams.caseId)" }
}
```

One case per `caseId` means concurrent intakes never bleed into each other:

```
ws://localhost:9220/drugsafety?caseId=VEL-301-0442   # hepatic failure
ws://localhost:9220/drugsafety?caseId=VEL-301-0518   # independent case
```

**`caseId` is required, and that is a safety property, not a convenience.** Because the parameter *is* the memory key, an omitted `caseId` would leave every unkeyed session sharing one empty conversation ID — one associate's case narrative would surface in another's history. The trigger schema marks it required, and the flow adds a runtime guard: `StartActivity` has two conditional links, and a blank `caseId` routes to `RejectMissingCaseId` instead of the LLM Client.

```
StartActivity ──[ caseId != "" ]──> SafetyIntakeLLMClient ──> Log ──> WebSocket Write
              └─[ caseId == "" ]──> RejectMissingCaseId (WebSocket Write, no LLM call)
```

Connecting without one gets a message explaining how to reconnect, and no tokens are spent:

```bash
$ websocat "ws://localhost:9220/drugsafety"
> anything
< Missing required query parameter 'caseId'. Reconnect as
  ws://<host>:<port>/drugsafety?caseId=<case or subject reference>. ...
```

24 messages is roughly a dozen turns — enough for a full triage plus follow-up questions. Raise it for longer case discussions, at the cost of prompt length on every call.

> Memory is **in-process and not durable**: restarting the app clears every conversation. That is fine for a triage aid where the ICSR itself is the system of record, but if you need an auditable transcript under 21 CFR Part 11, move to the AI Agent Trigger with a **Custom Conversation Store** — see [Healthcare Patient Support Agent](../Healthcare-Compliance-Agent/).

| `lookup_investigational_product` | `product:read` | `product_code` (required) — e.g. `IMP-4471` | INN, sponsor, protocol, phase, indication, route, subjects exposed, the Reference Safety Information in force with its listed reactions, and any active safety concerns |
| `search_case_history` | `cases:read` | `product_code`, `reaction_term` (both required) | Matching ICSRs with onset date, country, seriousness, outcome, causality and dechallenge; observed vs background rate; open signal status and owner |
| `check_label_expectedness` | `labeling:read` | `product_code`, `reaction_term` (both required) | `listed` true/false, `expectedness` LISTED/UNEXPECTED, rationale, nearest listed term, the regulatory consequence, and the 7-day / 15-day reporting clocks |

### A2A Server Tools (RegulatoryReportingA2A.flogo — port 9222, static token required)

All three tool schemas set `required` and `additionalProperties: false`, so a malformed call is rejected at the tool boundary rather than producing a half-populated safety record.

| Tool | Parameters | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `create_safety_case` | `product_code`, `reaction_term`, `seriousness` (enum, `Non-serious` or one of six `Serious - …` criteria), `expectedness` (`LISTED`\|`UNEXPECTED`), `causality` (`Related`\|`Probable`\|`Possible`\|`Unlikely`\|`Unrelated`), `patient_reference`, `narrative` — **all required** | Case number, SUSAR determination and rationale, clock start, reporting clock, submission due date, assigned physician, signal-team notification. Branches on all three of seriousness, expectedness and causality — see below |
| `submit_expedited_report` | `case_number`, `destination` — both required; `destination` is an enum of exactly `FDA` or `EMA` | Submission ID, E2B(R3) message type, transmission timestamp, acknowledgement code and authority case ID, days remaining, per-recipient distribution status |
| `get_case_status` | `case_number` (required) | Case state, owner, clock and days remaining, submission history per authority, outstanding follow-up requests with due dates, DSUR impact |

> **All three ICH E2A criteria drive the SUSAR decision.** A case is a SUSAR only when it is **serious** *and* **unexpected** *and* carries a **reasonable possibility of causal relationship** — miss any one and it is not a SUSAR. `create_safety_case_flow` encodes that with a `#actreturn` `@conditional` whose five branches are mutually exclusive, so the ordering of the list cannot change the answer:
>
> | Seriousness | Expectedness | Causality | Case | SUSAR | Clock |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | Death or life-threatening | `UNEXPECTED` | Related / Probable / Possible | ICSR-2026-01587 | yes | **7 calendar days** |
> | Any other serious criterion | `UNEXPECTED` | Related / Probable / Possible | ICSR-2026-01588 | yes | **15 calendar days** |
> | Any serious criterion | `UNEXPECTED` | Unlikely / Unrelated | ICSR-2026-01590 | no | none — DSUR |
> | Any serious criterion | `LISTED` | any | ICSR-2026-01589 | no | none — DSUR |
> | `Non-serious` | any | any | ICSR-2026-01591 | no | none — DSUR |
>
> Anything else returns an `error` rather than inventing a classification. This matters because it is the one judgement in the whole flow that a regulator would audit: calling a listed or unrelated reaction a SUSAR triggers a filing that was never required, calling an unexpected one listed misses the deadline entirely, and putting a fatal case on the 15-day clock misses it by eight days. `seriousness` and `causality` are `enum`s in the tool schema for the same reason `destination` is — the branch conditions are plain string equality, so a value outside the enum has to be rejected at the tool boundary rather than silently falling through to `@otherwise`.

> **One authority per call.** `submit_expedited_report_flow` branches on `destination` the same way: `FDA` returns the FAERS receipt, `EMA` returns the EudraVigilance receipt, and anything else returns an `error` without pretending a submission happened. Filing with both agencies means two calls — which is what a real E2B(R3) gateway integration looks like too.

> **These are still mocks.** Both flows return prepared fixtures rather than echoing every argument back, so the product code and subject reference in a response are the fixture's, not yours. The branches cover the fields that change the regulatory outcome — `seriousness`, `expectedness`, `causality` and `destination` — which is where a wrong answer would actually mislead. Swap the `@conditional` for a real gateway call and the tool contracts stay as they are.

## Prerequisites

- **TIBCO Flogo 2.26.5 or later**. For more information, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.tibco.com/pub/flogo/latest/doc/html/Default.htm#connectors/agentic-AI/agentic-AI-overview.htm)
- An **OpenAI API key** (or swap for Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, or vLLM in the LLM configuration properties)
- A WebSocket client: the browser [Flogo Chatbot](../../Chatbot/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat)

---

## Setup & Configuration

The two backends must be running before the advisor, otherwise the LLM Client has nothing to authenticate against.

### Step 1 — Start the Safety Signal MCP Server

Open `SafetySignalMCPServer.flogo` in the Flogo VS Code extension and run it. It listens on **9221** at `/mcp` and requires a bearer token out of the box:

| Property | Default |
|---|---|
| `FlogoMcpServer.PORT` | `9221` |
| `FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TYPE` | `API Key` |
| `FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TOKEN` | `pv-mcp-a7f3c9e24b814d6e9c052f8a1b3d7e64` (stored encrypted, shown masked in the editor) |

Confirm auth is actually being enforced — the first call must fail and the second must succeed:

```bash
# No token -> 401 Unauthorized
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:9221/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'

# With the token -> 200 and the three tools
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9221/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pv-mcp-a7f3c9e24b814d6e9c052f8a1b3d7e64" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
```

### Step 2 — Configure and Start the Regulatory Reporting A2A Server

Open `RegulatoryReportingA2A.flogo` and set your API key in **App Properties**. The field is masked because the shipped value is an encrypted `SECRET:...` placeholder — clear it and type your own key, and the editor re-encrypts on save:

```
AgenticAI.openai.API_Key = sk-your-key-here
```

Run it. The agent listens on **9222** with `A2A.AuthMode = Static Token` and `A2A.AuthToken = pv-a2a-5d90b7c14e2f48a3b6e17c09d24f8a51` (stored encrypted, shown masked in the editor).

Verify the agent card is served and the token is enforced:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9222/.well-known/agent-card.json

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:9222/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"message/send","id":1,"params":{}}'   # expect 401

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9222/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pv-a2a-5d90b7c14e2f48a3b6e17c09d24f8a51" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"message/send","id":1,"params":{}}'
```

### Step 3 — Configure and Start the Drug Safety Advisor

Open `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` and set:

```
LLMClient.LLM_Provider = OpenAI
LLMClient.API_Key      = sk-your-key-here
LLMClient.LLM_Model    = gpt-5-nano
LLMClient.LLM_Base_URL =                 # leave empty for OpenAI's own endpoint
```

`LLMClient.API_Key` is masked for the same reason — replace the encrypted placeholder with your own key.

The backend URLs and tokens default to the values above. **If you change a token on a backend, change it here too** — the pairs must match. Because both sides are masked, you cannot eyeball them for equality; a mismatch shows up only as a **401** at runtime:

```
LLMClient.MCP.Safety.Auth_Token      <-->  FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TOKEN
LLMClient.A2A.Regulatory.Auth_Token  <-->  A2A.AuthToken
```

Run it. The WebSocket server starts on **9220**.

### Step 4 — Connect and Triage a Case

**Flogo Chatbot**: start the browser client in [`Chatbot/`](../../Chatbot/) and point it at `ws://localhost:9220/drugsafety?caseId=VEL-301-0442`.

**websocat**:
```bash
websocat "ws://localhost:9220/drugsafety?caseId=VEL-301-0442"
```

**Postman**: new WebSocket request to the same URL, then Connect.

The `caseId` query parameter becomes the `conversationId`, so every message on the same `caseId` shares history. It is **required** — connect without it and the flow replies with a short error instead of calling the LLM, because an unkeyed session would share its history with every other unkeyed session.

### Example Multi-Turn Conversation

```
> Site 0044 called. Subject VEL-301-0442 on IMP-4471 was hospitalised yesterday
  with acute hepatic failure. Investigator assessed causality as probable.
< Confirmed IMP-4471 (Velcaridine), protocol VEL-301, Phase III. The RSI in force
  is Investigator's Brochure v6.0. Hepatic failure is UNEXPECTED (not listed) —
  Section 6.3 lists only asymptomatic transaminase elevation.
  Serious (hospitalisation) + unexpected + probable causality = SUSAR, 15-day clock.
  Do you have all four minimum criteria?

> Yes. What do we already know about hepatic events on this product?
< Three prior cases across 1,240 exposed subjects, all with positive dechallenge.
  Observed rate 2.42 per 1,000 vs a 0.14 background rate. Signal SIG-2026-0033
  has been open with the Hepatology Signal Team since 2026-04-11.
  Shall I open the ICSR?

> Yes, open it and file with FDA.
< Case ICSR-2026-01588 created — SUSAR, clock started 2026-09-25, due 2026-10-10.
  Filed with FDA: SUB-2026-FDA-004417, ack AA, FAERS-29104778.
  EMA has not been filed — shall I submit to EudraVigilance as well?

> Yes, file with EMA too.
< Filed with EMA: SUB-2026-EMA-004418, ack AA, EV-2026-DE-0088431.
  BfArM notified through the EudraVigilance re-routing rules.
```

Each `submit_expedited_report` call files with exactly one authority — `destination` is an enum of `FDA` or `EMA`, and the mock branches on it, so asking for EMA never returns an FDA receipt.

Notice that the advisor calls `check_label_expectedness` rather than judging expectedness itself, and asks before writing.

**Start an independent case:**
```bash
websocat "ws://localhost:9220/drugsafety?caseId=VEL-301-0518"
```

### Seeing Auth Fail

To prove the tokens are load-bearing, break one and watch the tool call fail while the conversation keeps working:

1. In `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo`, change `LLMClient.MCP.Safety.Auth_Token` to `wrong-token`.
2. Restart the advisor and ask about IMP-4471.
3. The MCP server returns **401**, the LLM reports that it cannot reach the safety database, and the app log shows the failed tool call. The A2A hop is unaffected — its token is separate.

## App Properties Reference

> The six API key and token properties are stored as encrypted `SECRET:...` values, so the editor renders them as masked password fields and the `.flogo` file never contains the token text. Their `type` stays `"string"` — Flogo derives the password rendering from the `SECRET:` value prefix, not from the declared type. The tables below list the **decrypted** values, which is what actually travels in the `Authorization` header. To change one, retype it in the editor and let it re-encrypt; hand-editing the JSON to a plaintext value also works but undoes the masking.

## What to Customize

| Customization | Where | How |
|---|---|---|
| Rotate the MCP token | Both apps | Retype `FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TOKEN` and `LLMClient.MCP.Safety.Auth_Token` to the same new value. Both are masked, so type carefully — the two ciphertexts will differ even when the plaintext matches, and a mismatch surfaces only as a runtime **401** |
| Rotate the A2A token | Both apps | Same drill for `A2A.AuthToken` and `LLMClient.A2A.Regulatory.Auth_Token` |
| Move secrets out of the app | Platform secret store | `SECRET:` uses Flogo's built-in default key, so anyone with the tooling can decrypt it. For production, inject the values from your platform's secret store rather than shipping them in the `.flogo` file |
| Enforce per-tool scopes | MCP Server | Set `FlogoMcpServer.AUTH_TYPE` to `JWT Token` and supply a signed JWT as the client token — the `scope` values are already on every tool |
| External IdP (Keycloak, Auth0, Entra ID) | MCP Server | Set `authType` to `OAuth 2.0` and fill in `oauthIssuer`, `oauthJWKSURL`, `oauthAudience`, `oauthRequiredScopes` |
| Add TLS to the MCP Server | `SafetySignalMCPServer.flogo` | The MCP Server trigger terminates TLS itself: set `enableTLS: true` with `serverCertificate` / `serverPrivateKey`, then switch `LLMClient.MCP.Safety.Server_URL` to `https://` |
| Add TLS to the A2A Server | Platform ingress / reverse proxy | The Agent Trigger has **no** `enableTLS` setting — terminate TLS in front of it (TIBCO Platform ingress, an nginx/Envoy reverse proxy, or a service mesh), then point both `A2A.AgentUrl` and `LLMClient.A2A.Regulatory.Server_URL` at the `https://` address so the published agent card matches |
| Add TLS to the WebSocket endpoint | `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` | The WebSocket trigger terminates TLS itself: set `enableTLS: true` with `serverCert` / `serverKey`, then connect over `wss://` |
| **Authenticate the caller** | `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` + ingress | Ships as `enableClientAuth: false`, so port 9220 is open to anyone who can reach it. Set `enableClientAuth: true` (requires TLS above) or front the app with authenticated ingress, then derive `caseId` from the authenticated principal instead of the query parameter — otherwise a caller can name any case and read its history back |
| Log less, or redact | `LogResponse` in `DrugSafetyAdvisor.flogo` | The activity logs a completion event and a response length only. If you add case data back for debugging, remember the narratives may contain patient data and INFO logs usually ship to a central collector — route it through a redaction step or drop the level |
| Connect a real safety database | Flows in `SafetySignalMCPServer.flogo` | Replace `#actreturn` with queries against Argus Safety, ArisGlobal LifeSphere, or Veeva Vault Safety |
| Real E2B(R3) submission | `submit_expedited_report_flow` | The flow already branches on `destination`; replace each `#actreturn` branch with a call to the matching gateway (FDA ESG / EMA EudraVigilance) and add a branch per authority you support |
| Add a second MCP server | `mcpServerConfigs` mapping | Add another entry — e.g. a MedDRA coding server — each with its own `authType` and `authToken` |
| Use Anthropic Claude | App properties | Set `LLMClient.LLM_Provider` to `Anthropic` and `LLMClient.LLM_Model` to a Claude model |
| Keep data on-premises | App properties | Set `LLMClient.LLM_Provider` to `Ollama` or `vLLM` and point `LLMClient.LLM_Base_URL` at your endpoint — relevant when case narratives contain patient data |
| Durable, auditable memory | LLM Client Activity | Move to the AI Agent Trigger with a Custom Conversation Store for a 21 CFR Part 11 transcript |

## A Note on Scope

This sample is a **triage aid**, not a regulatory decision system. The system prompt deliberately makes the LLM defer expectedness to the labeling tool, defer causality to the investigator, ask before every write, and flag ambiguity to the medical safety physician. Any real deployment needs qualified person oversight, validation under GxP, and an audit trail — all of which sit outside what this sample demonstrates. The pharmacovigilance data here is fictional.
