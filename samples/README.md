# **TIBCO Flogo® Samples**

Ready-to-run sample applications for **TIBCO Flogo®** — the low-code / no-code iPaaS for building **AI agents**, **MCP servers**, **enterprise integration flows**, and **event-driven microservices**. Explore everything from Agentic AI orchestration and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to REST/gRPC/GraphQL APIs, database connectors, and Docker deployment patterns.

## Agentic AI Samples

Build, orchestrate, and govern AI agents inside Flogo integration flows using the **Agentic AI Connector** (LLM Client Activity, AI Agent Activity, AI Agent Trigger) and the **Flogo-as-MCP-server** pattern. The [`Agentic_AI/`](./Agentic_AI/) folder holds two collections: **feature samples** (below) that each teach a building block, and **end-to-end industry use-case demos** grouped by vertical (see [Industry Use-Case Demos](#agentic-ai-industry-use-case-demos)).

**➡️ Full details, prerequisites & Quick Start: [Agentic AI README](./Agentic_AI/README.md)**

All share the browser [Chatbot](./Agentic_AI/Chatbot/) test client. See the [Agentic AI README](./Agentic_AI/README.md#part-2--industry-use-case-demos) for the full catalog, ports, and status of each.
