# Flogo Design Assistant (FDA) Sample Prompts

This readme file features ready-to-use prompts for building a range of Flogo applications using the FDA CLI.
Prompts cover REST APIs, databases, AWS, OpenAPI spec, schema mapping, and more.
Use these as templates for rapid app creation, noting any manual post-prompt steps described below.

---

## Sample Prompt 1 — REST + SQL Server CRUD

**Prompt:**

> - Create a Flogo application based on the image `<path-of-image>`. Replace PostgreSQL with SQL Server and pass the database details.
> - Table name should be BookStore.
> - Don't update file manually, use fda only.

**Manual steps needed to run the app end to end:**

- Trigger handlers created via FDA CLI have an unnecessary `body:object` on GET/DELETE and a missing `schemas` block (causes nil pointer panic) -- click **Sync** on trigger handler in VS Code to fix both.
- SQL query activities with prepared parameters (e.g. `?BookId`) get collapsed into a JSON literal on `input.input` by `fda mm` (make-mapping) -- manually set the leaf-level parameter mapping in app.

---

## Sample Prompt 2 — REST + SQL Server with @foreach Mapper

**Prompt:**

> - Create a Flogo app `Rest_BookStore_ListAll` based on the image `<path-of-image>`.
> - Replace PostgreSQL with SQL Server database and pass the database details.
> - Table name should be BookStore.
> - Use a Mapper with `@foreach` to transform SQL result records into a response array.
> - Don't update file manually, use fda only.

**Manual steps needed to run the app end to end:**

- Trigger handlers created via FDA CLI have an unnecessary `body:object` on GET/DELETE and a missing `schemas` block (causes nil pointer panic) -- click **Sync** on trigger handler in VS Code to fix both.

---

## Sample Prompt 3 — App Properties + Trigger Port Binding

**Prompt:**

> - Create a simple Flogo application with multiple app properties of different data types (e.g., string, integer, boolean), each initialized with sample values. Then demonstrate using those properties within the app's flow.
> - Add `Port` as app property and pass value as `8765` and bind it in REST Trigger.

**Manual steps needed to run the app end to end:**

- Trigger handlers created via FDA CLI have an unnecessary `body:object` on GET/DELETE and a missing `schemas` block (causes nil pointer panic) -- click **Sync** on trigger handler in VS Code to fix both.

## Sample Prompt 4 — AWS SQS (Multi-Flow App)

### Prompt 4a — Send SQS Message

> - Create Flogo app named "SQS-App" and create AWS Connection using details as below.
> - Create Flow named "Send SQS Message to Queue".
> - In Flow, add REST trigger and use GET method and add Send SQS Message activity and use above created connection in it.
> - Create app property for Queue URL and pass `<queue-url>` and bind app property in activity.
> - Also, configure the activity to push a dummy message to the queue and include dummy message attributes.
> - Don't update file manually and use FDA only.

### Prompt 4b — Receive SQS Message

> - In same app, create another Flow named "Receive Message from Queue".
> - Add Receive SQS Message Trigger and bind available Connection.
> - In Queue URL dropdown, bind the app property available for it and also add message attributes that we added previously in activity.
> - Add Log message activity in flow and in message field map Message field from trigger flow output.
> - No direct file update.

**Manual steps needed to run the app end to end:**

- Trigger handlers created via FDA CLI have an unnecessary `body:object` on GET/DELETE and a missing `schemas` block (causes nil pointer panic) -- click **Sync** on trigger handler in VS Code to fix both.

---

## Sample Prompt 5 — REST API from OpenAPI Spec

**Prompt:**

> - Create Flogo REST API app using api spec file `<path-of-spec-file>`.
> - Add some dummy implementation in the newly created flows before the Configure HTTP Response based on the schema it is expecting.

**Manual steps needed to run the app end to end:**

- Just make changes in dummy implementation as per your requirements and run the app.

---

## Sample Prompt 6 — Request/Response Schema Binding

**Prompt:**

> - Create a Flogo app called "RestTrigger-RequestResponseSchema".
> - Add a REST trigger in flow and it should receive a POST request at `/rec1`.
> - Create a schema "project info" with below properties:
>   - `projectId`, `status`, `teams` (where each team has a `teamName`, `specialty`, and a list of `members` — each member has a required `id` as number and required `name` as string).
> - Bind this schema in REST Trigger Request and Response schema.
> - Also add Mapper, LogMessage, and Return activity in flow and link them in sequence.
> - Set the "project info" schema on the Mapper and map all request body fields through it.
> - Wire LogMessage and Return to use the Mapper output.

**Manual steps needed to run the app end to end:**

- In the REST trigger, click the **Sync** button on the Response Schema to populate flow output properties, then map the flow output data object to the trigger reply data.

---

## Sample Prompt 7 — Invoke REST Service + Log Response

**Prompt:**

> - Create a Flogo app "DemoRestApp" with a flow "GetPostFlow" and add a REST trigger (GET, path `/api/getpost`).
> - Add an Invoke REST Service activity that calls `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1` using GET method with a response schema having fields: `userId` (integer), `id` (integer), `title` (string), `body` (string).
> - Add a Log Message activity to log the title from the response. Map the invoke response to the trigger reply.

**Manual steps needed to run the app end to end:**

- Trigger handlers created via FDA CLI have an unnecessary `body:object` on GET/DELETE and a missing `schemas` block (causes nil pointer panic) -- click **Sync** on trigger handler in VS Code to fix both.

---

## Sample Prompt 8 — Nested Array/Object Transformation

**Prompt:**

> - Create a Flogo app called "NestedArrayObjects" with a REST API that accepts a POST request on `/orders`. The request body contains an order with the following structure:
>   - `orderId` (string)
>   - `customer` (string)
>   - `lineItems` (array of objects), where each line item has:
>     - `productId` (string)
>     - `quantity` (number)
>     - `subItems` (array of objects), where each sub-item has:
>       - `subItemId` (string)
>       - `subItemName` (string)
> - Use a Mapper to transform the input into a different output structure with renamed fields. Return the mapped output as the API response with HTTP status 200.

**Manual steps needed to run the app end to end:**

- In the REST trigger, click the **Sync** button on the Response Schema to populate flow output properties, then map the flow output data object to the trigger reply data.

## Sample Prompt 9 — Multi-level JSON Structures

**Prompt:**

> Create a Flogo app called `test_multilevel.flogo` that tests resolving multi-level JSON structures in mappings. The app should have a timer-triggered flow with two mapper activities and a log activity:
>
> 1. **Source mapper** — produces a deeply nested JSON object (4 levels deep) representing an order: `orderId`, `total` (number), a `customer` with `name` and `email` who has an `address` with `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip`, and a `payment` method that has a `card` with `last4` and `expiry`.
> 2. **Resolver mapper** — pulls fields from different nesting levels into a flat structure (e.g. `customerName`, `shippingCity`, `cardLast4`).

---

## Sample Prompt 10 — Dynamic Lookups with json.jq

**Prompt:**

> - Create a Flogo app with a timer-triggered flow that does dynamic lookups across a collection.
> - A Source mapper produces a catalog array of products, each with a `code`, `name`, and `price`, plus a `searchCode` field.
> - A Lookup mapper uses `json.jq` to find the product matching the search code from the catalog and extracts its name and price into flat output fields. Log the lookup result.

**Status:** Working fine end to end.

---

## Sample Prompt 11 — Inbuilt Functions

**Prompt:**

> - Create a Flogo app with a timer-triggered flow that transforms customer data.
> - A Source mapper provides a customer name, an email address, an order amount with decimals and a list of tags.
> - A Transform mapper should: uppercase the customer name and add a "CUSTOMER: " prefix, extract the username part before the `@` from the email, round the order amount to the nearest whole number, count how many tags there are, add the current date as a timestamp, and generate a unique transaction ID.
> - Log the transformed result.

## Sample Prompt 12 — MCP Server from OpenAPI Spec + Mock Server

### Prompt 12a — Create MCP Server App

> I have an OpenAPI spec file at `<path>/weather-forecast-api.json`.
> Create a Flogo MCP Server app from this spec.
> Set the API endpoint to `http://localhost:9999` and MCP port to `3040`.

### Prompt 12b — Create Mock REST Server

> I don't have a real Weather API. Create a dummy Flogo REST server using the same OpenAPI spec `<path>/weather-forecast-api.json` on port 9999 that returns sample data for all endpoints.
> Add a Mapper activity in each flow between Log and ConfigureHTTPResponse to set the dummy response data, then pass it to ConfigureHTTPResponse.

---

## Sample Prompt 13 — Insert Activity Between Existing Activities

### Prompt 13a — Create Base App

> Create a REST API app called OrderProcessor that receives a POST request at `/orders`. Log the incoming order details, then return a success response.

### Prompt 13b — Insert Mapper Activity

> Add a Mapper activity between the Log and Return activities to transform the order data before returning it.
