description: Build a customer/industry/vertical-specific Agentic AI use case (demo) on TIBCO Flogo Enterprise — a real-time WebSocket chatbot backed by three apps: an MCP Server (read-only DB lookup tools), an A2A Agents app (write/action agents), and an AI Orchestrator that classifies intent and routes between them. Two build methods, and the skill ASKS which: the Flogo Design CLI (`fda`) built from scratch (the RECOMMENDED DEFAULT), or cloning an existing reference `.flogo` and swapping fields. Use when the user asks to build/create/scaffold an agentic AI use case, demo, chatbot, or "MCP + A2A + orchestrator" solution for ANY domain (telecom, airline, hospital, banking, retail, insurance, logistics, utilities, …), whether they want it constructed via CLI commands or cloned from a sample. Produces PostgreSQL-backed .flogo apps + database.sql + reset_data.sql + prompts.md + README, modeled on the reference use cases under samples/Agentic_AI/Industry_Use_Cases_old/*_Use_Case.

# Agentic AI Use Case Builder

Scaffolds a complete, runnable Agentic AI demo for **any** vertical, following the proven 3-app pattern used by the reference use cases (e.g. Airline Passenger Services, Hospital, Telecom Invoice Chatbot). Everything here is domain-agnostic — you supply the domain, the skill supplies the structure, the wiring, and the gotchas that are easy to get wrong.

## Two build methods (the skill ASKS — see Phase 0a)

| | **FDA-CLI (default)** | **Clone-and-adapt** |
|---|---|---|
| How apps are built | Every app constructed by `fda` (`flogodesign-cli`) commands, from scratch | Clone an existing working `.flogo` and swap fields |
| Best when | You want a clean, auditable build with no leftover UUIDs/secrets/`contrib` blobs, and no hand-assembled trigger/reply JSON to get subtly wrong | You have a **near-identical reference app**, or the app needs **custom-extension activities the FDA recipes don't cover** (e.g. the `extensions/openAI` vector activities: `vectorStoreCreate`/`fileUpload`/`fileList`/`vectorSearch`) |
| Verification | `python -m json.tool` + `fda cm` + the mapping validator; optionally `flogobuild` to `.exe` + live run | Import + live run; same mapping validator |

**Same output, different HOW.** Most phases (0, 0b, 1, 2, 3, 5) are identical; only Phase 4 (Build) splits into **4A (FDA)** and **4B (clone)**, and a few gotchas are method-specific (grouped at the end).

## Hard rules

**Shared (both methods):**
- **Never regenerate/re-clone a `.flogo` once it has been opened/edited in the Flogo designer.** Re-running a build (any `fda cc`/`cap` that recreates connections/properties, or a re-clone) **wipes manual edits**: it reverts secret values (DB password, email password, API key) to placeholders **and** mints a *new* connection UUID, which orphans every activity `input.Connection` (`conn://<id>`) and every orchestrator `mcpServers`/`remoteAgents` ref → the designer clears them to `""` on next save (empty dropdowns, "Connection is required"). For a bug in a designer-touched file, make the **minimal, surgical** change to only the broken field(s) on the existing file (read the current connection id back from that same file and set the literal), leaving secrets and Synced schemas byte-for-byte intact.
- **Never write to a `.flogo` that's open in the designer.** The disk write races with unsaved designer state (a clicked-but-unsaved **Sync** is lost on reload). Have the user Save or set aside unsaved work, then **Discard** + close the tab before you patch, then reload.
- **Do NOT build binaries unless the user explicitly asks.** Never run `flogobuild build-exe` proactively ("to verify a fix"). Design-time verification (`python -m json.tool`, `fda cm`, grep that refs resolve, the mapping validator) is the default "done" signal. When the user *does* ask for a build, run it in the **foreground** (real-time output), never in the background.

**FDA-mode only:** every structural change to a `.flogo` goes through an `fda` subcommand (`cp`, `cap`, `cc`, `ct`, `cf`, `ca`, `cth`, `wth`, `cs`, `sa`, `mm`, …). The **only** direct-JSON touch permitted is passing a JSON *value* to `fda sa … --jsonValue`/`--jsonFile` (still an `fda` call). Do not open a generated `.flogo` in an editor and change nodes by hand. *(Exception: the surgical repairs and secret-scrubbing above/below, which have no `fda` subcommand.)*

**Clone-mode only:** **carry over the `contrib` base64 blobs and every `SECRET:` value verbatim** from the cloned app — they are environment/version-specific boilerplate, not domain data. Regenerating them by hand breaks import. Write a real `""` for an empty base URL — never the literal text `New_value`.

## What it produces

A new folder `<TargetDir>/<UseCase>_Use_Case/` (target resolved in Phase 0b — default the apps folder from `config.md`, or the `samples/Agentic_AI/` catalogue if contributing a demo; confirm with the user) containing:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `database.sql` | PostgreSQL schema + demo data, engineered so each demo scenario works |
| `reset_data.sql` | TRUNCATE + reload; clears agent-written tables; volatile dates made relative to today |
| `<Prefix>MCPServer.flogo` | **1 MCP Server** — N read-only tools, each querying one table/join |
| `<Prefix>Agents.flogo` | **1 A2A Agents app** — M business-logic/action agents (write workflows), each its own trigger/port. **Default action = write directly to PostgreSQL** or send email. **No separate REST/backend app unless the user explicitly asks** (see the default-action hard rule below). |
| `<Prefix>AIOrchestrator.flogo` | **1 AI Orchestrator** — WebSocket trigger, an AI Agent activity that routes to MCP tools or A2A agents |
| `prompts.md` | Demo prompts grouped by scenario |
| `README.md` | Architecture, apps/tools/agents tables, DB summary, demo scenarios, **prerequisites (incl. connector prerequisites) + setup steps + "Configure before running end to end" list**, ports, troubleshooting. **In FDA mode, author it FIRST as the approval artifact (Phase 3)**, then finalize with real ports/commands + the manual-config gap section. |
| `_rebuild/` *(FDA mode only)* | The kept `fda` driver scripts (one per app) for replaying this build — see Phase 4A "Keep the drivers". |

> **A2A app naming:** name the A2A-agents app **`<Prefix>Agents.flogo`**, not `<Prefix>A2AServers.flogo`. (Existing reference apps under `samples/Agentic_AI/` still use the older `A2AServers` name — leave those as-is; use `Agents` for anything new.)

Architecture (all reference use cases share it):

```
Chatbot UI --WebSocket--> AI Orchestrator --MCP(HTTP streamable)--> MCP Server --\
                                 |                                                +--> PostgreSQL
                                 \-----------A2A (HTTP)-----> A2A Agents ---------/   (+ SMTP for email)
```
- **MCP Server** = read-only lookups. Stateless, safe to retry; the LLM picks tools by their description.
- **A2A Agents** = action workflows — **write directly to PostgreSQL** (`act_postgresql_query` to validate, `act_postgresql_insert` for INSERT/UPDATE) or send email (`act_general_sendmail`). Own guardrails, multi-step, separate deploy/scale.
- **Orchestrator** = the AI brain. WebSocket chat; the LLM decides intent and calls MCP tools or hands off to A2A agents.

> **Default-action hard rule (verified across the reference use cases):** A2A action agents write **directly to PostgreSQL** or send **email** — the canonical write flow is `noop → log → [query to validate] → insert → log → actreturn`, and every use case includes one dedicated `send_confirmation_email` agent (`noop → sendmail → log → actreturn`). **Do NOT create a separate REST/backend service app, and do NOT use `act_general_rest` in the A2A agents, unless the user explicitly asks for a REST backend.** Of the six canonical reference use cases, five (Airline, Life & Pensions, Power Distribution, Retail Banking, Telecom) write directly to Postgres; only **Hospital** calls a REST backend, and it is the documented outlier — do not copy its `#rest`/`act_general_rest` pattern for a default build.

## Reference files (read before building)

Shared, domain-agnostic guidance (both methods):
- [references/use-case-spec-template.md](references/use-case-spec-template.md) — the **spec** the user fills (spec-driven development). Defines the WHAT/WHY; this skill supplies the HOW. See "Spec-driven development" below.
- [references/flogo-app-templates.md](references/flogo-app-templates.md) — exact JSON structure of all 3 apps: triggers, flows, connections, `contrib` blobs, ports, UUID rules. **(Clone mode leans on this heavily; FDA mode uses it to understand the target shape.)**
- [references/postgres-activity-patterns.md](references/postgres-activity-patterns.md) — **the critical gotchas**: how to parameterize `#query` and (especially) `#insert`/UPDATE so the Flogo mapper doesn't break. Read this every time — it is the #1 source of errors.
- [references/data-and-docs.md](references/data-and-docs.md) — conventions for `database.sql`, `reset_data.sql`, `prompts.md`, and the combined `README.md`.
- [references/connector-prereqs.md](references/connector-prereqs.md) — connectors that need a designtime prerequisite, the read-only grep that detects them, and the exact install instruction for the hand-off (Phase 5).
- [references/chatbot-test.md](references/chatbot-test.md) — how the user brings up the shared chatbot (`samples/Agentic_AI/Chatbot`) and connects it to the orchestrator, including the **↻ icon** step people miss. Fill it in and put it at the end of the hand-off and in the README (Phase 5).
- [references/build-cost-and-time.md](references/build-cost-and-time.md) — build/runtime cost, time and token estimates + a lean prompt template. **Show it ONLY when the user asks** about tokens, cost, time, or cheaper builds — never upfront.

FDA-specific method (used only in FDA mode):
- [references/fda-build-recipes.md](references/fda-build-recipes.md) — **the core FDA recipe**: exact `fda` command sequences to build the MCP Server, A2A Agents, and Orchestrator from scratch, including the runtime gotchas that each caused a distinct failure. The **default A2A recipe writes directly to PostgreSQL** (`act_postgresql_insert`); the REST-backend recipe is present but **opt-in — use it only if the user explicitly asks**.
- [references/fda-limitations.md](references/fda-limitations.md) — the **official TIBCO Flogo Design Assistant (Tech Preview) limitations**, mapped to the exact manual step each one forces on the user (Sync non-OpenAPI triggers, validate connections, set password as a `SECRET:` value, certificates/branches/loops/error-handlers). Read this to decide what goes in the manual-config-gap handoff.
- [references/manual-config-gap.md](references/manual-config-gap.md) — the **"below things are not configured…"** checklist to paste at the end of the generated `README.md` (FDA mode; the clone-mode hand-off is a lighter version of the same items).

## Reference use cases (study these before building — both methods)

Several Agentic AI use cases live under the reference folder (resolved in Phase 0b, default `samples/Agentic_AI/`); the **canonical references** to study are the six below. Read the ones closest to the requested domain to match structure, README shape, `prompts.md` format, `database.sql` conventions, and the direct-Postgres A2A pattern. Each ships exactly three apps (`<Prefix>MCPServer` / `<Prefix>A2AServers` / `<Prefix>AIOrchestrator`; name new A2A-agents builds `<Prefix>Agents`) plus `database.sql`, `reset_data.sql`, `prompts.md`, `README.md`.

| Use case | Folder | Persona | A2A action pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Airline Passenger Services | `Airline_Passenger_Services_Use_Case` | Passenger (customer) | **Direct PostgreSQL** *(ignore the `airline-*.flogo` + `swagger.json` LEGACY 2-tier prototype)* |
| Life & Pensions | `Life_And_Pensions_Use_Case` | Pension member (customer) | **Direct PostgreSQL** |
| Power Distribution | `Power_Distribution_Use_Case` | Residential electricity customer | **Direct PostgreSQL** |
| Retail Banking | `Retail_Banking_Assistant_Use_Case` | Retail banking customer | **Direct PostgreSQL** |
| Telecom Invoice Chatbot | `Telecom_Invoice_Chatbot_Use_Case` | Telecom subscriber (customer) | **Direct PostgreSQL** |
| Hospital AI-Agent | `Hospital_AI-Agent_Use_Case` | Hospital staff (operator) | **REST backend — OUTLIER, do not copy for the default** |

**Canonical for the direct-Postgres default:** the five customer-facing use cases above. **Hospital restriction:** reference **only** its `README.md`, the `.sql` files, `prompts.md`, and the three apps **`Hospital_MCP_Server.flogo`**, **`HospitalA2AServers.flogo`**, **`HospitalAIOrchestrator.flogo`**. **Do NOT reference** `endevour-api.flogo`, `eai-api.flogo`, or `post-discharge-agent.flogo` — those belong to an older 4-app REST-backed architecture; that pattern is the documented REST example, **not** the default.

## Spec-driven development (recommended input)

This skill is the **constitution + plan + implementer**; the user supplies the **spec**. SDD separates WHAT/WHY (spec) from HOW (plan/implementation):

| SDD phase | Owned by | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Constitution (invariants: MCP=reads, A2A=writes, WebSocket orchestrator, PostgreSQL param patterns) | this skill | "Key facts" + "Top gotchas" below |
| Specify / Clarify (requirements, scenarios, acceptance, interface contracts) | the **user** | a filled `*.spec.md` from [references/use-case-spec-template.md](references/use-case-spec-template.md), OR the README approved in Phase 3 |
| Plan → Tasks → Implement → Validate | this skill | Workflow Phases 3–5 |

**If the user provides a filled spec or an existing README** (e.g. "build the X use case from `x.spec.md`"), read it and treat it as Phase 1–2 input: frame it back (Phase 1) from the spec's Intent/actors, and in Phase 2 ask only about its "Assumptions & open questions" and any missing sections — do not re-ask what the spec already answers. Map spec → build: information lookups → MCP tools, actions/workflows → A2A agents (direct-Postgres writes by default), entities → PostgreSQL tables, scenarios/seed-data → `database.sql` + `prompts.md`, acceptance criteria → the Phase 5 verification. A worked example is `samples/Agentic_AI/Industry_Use_Cases_old/Hospital_AI-Agent_Use_Case/hospital.spec.md`. **If the user has no spec**, run the interactive Phase 1–2 questions (they cover the same fields); the README (Phase 3) is the artifact the user actually approves.

---

## Workflow — always follow these phases in order

### Phase 0a — Confirm the build method FIRST (ask before anything else)  ⛔
Two methods build the same 3-app pattern, and **the user chooses which — always ASK (AskUserQuestion), never assume**, even when the request looks just like a past build:
- **FDA-CLI — the RECOMMENDED DEFAULT.** Every app is constructed by `fda` commands: a clean, auditable, from-scratch build with no leftover UUIDs/secrets/`contrib` blobs, and no hand-assembled trigger/reply JSON to get subtly wrong. Recommend this.
- **Clone-and-adapt.** Clone an existing `.flogo` and swap fields. Legitimately better when a near-identical reference app exists, **or when the app needs custom-extension activities the FDA recipes don't cover** (e.g. the `extensions/openAI` vector activities — `vectorStoreCreate`/`fileUpload`/`fileList`/`vectorSearch` have no `fda` recipe, so cloning a proven sample is the reliable path for those apps).

Present the choice, recommend FDA-CLI (default), and note the clone exception above. Then follow **Phase 4A** (FDA) or **Phase 4B** (clone) accordingly. (Do not silently pick a method — the RAG-extended Auto Insurance build was cloned without asking, and a hand-built REST trigger shipped with designer-only errors as a result.)

### Phase 0 — Read environment config (+ print tool paths+versions in FDA mode)
Read **`config.md`** (`../config.md` relative to this skill folder — it lives at `skills-library/.claude/skills/config.md`) first for: the `psql` path and PostgreSQL host/port/user/password/db; the OpenAI/LLM API key, base URL, model, and temperature (`LLM_Base_URL`, `LLM_Model`, `LLM_Temperature`); the SMTP username/app-password; and (FDA mode) the CLI paths for `flogodesign-cli` (`fda`) and `flogobuild`. **Do not hardcode any of these** — read them at build time. In FDA mode, before running any command, print the resolved `fda`/`flogobuild` **path and `version`** so the run is reproducible. Read secrets into shell/script variables; never echo them. **LLM defaults** — `config.md` values always win; only if the file or a key is missing use: `LLM_Model` = `gpt-5-nano`, `LLM_Base_URL` = truly empty `""` (see gotcha), `temperature` = `0`.

### Phase 0b — Locate the reference use cases + pick the output folder (portability) 📍
Resolve the **reference folder** (where the demos to study/clone live) in this order, and use it wherever this document says `samples/Agentic_AI/`:
1. If `config.md` defines `AGENTIC_USE_CASES_DIR`, use that path (relative to the repo root, or an absolute path).
2. Otherwise, if `samples/Agentic_AI/` exists at the repo root, use it — the default when the skill ships inside `flogo-enterprise-hub`.
3. Otherwise (skills-library installed standalone, no reference apps on disk):
   - **Clone mode:** **ask the user** to point you to the folder that holds the Agentic AI use-case apps — each a `*MCPServer.flogo` / `*Agents.flogo` (older reference apps: `*A2AServers.flogo`) / `*AIOrchestrator.flogo` trio. Do not guess a path or fabricate a template from memory; without a reference app to clone, clone mode cannot run reliably (offer to switch to FDA mode, which builds from self-contained recipes).
   - **FDA mode:** proceed from [references/fda-build-recipes.md](references/fda-build-recipes.md) alone — it is self-sufficient — and **do not block the build**; just skip the "study the reference" step.

**Output folder:** by default create the new use case under **`<FLOGO_APPS_DIR>/<UseCase>_Use_Case/`** — `FLOGO_APPS_DIR` from `config.md`, resolved relative to `config.md` (default `../../Flogo_Apps` → `skills-library/Flogo_Apps/`, the one physical folder shared by both workspace layouts). If the user is instead **contributing a new demo to the hub catalogue**, target `samples/Agentic_AI/<UseCase>_Use_Case/`. Either way, **confirm the target folder with the user** (Phase 3). Do not create apps at the `skills-library/` root or the repo root.

### Phase 1 — Identify the persona / frame the use case FIRST (before questions or code)
When the user gives only a domain, the **very first question is WHO the end user is** — because the persona determines the tables, the tone, and which actions exist. Ask an either/or framed to the domain, e.g. Airline → *"passenger/customer (self-service) or airline operator/agent (back-office)?"*; Banking → *"account holder or branch/call-center agent?"*; Hospital → *"a patient or hospital staff?"*. Most reference use cases are customer-facing self-service (5 of 6); Hospital is the operator-facing one. Once the persona is fixed, state back in a few lines:
1. **How that persona interacts** — they chat in natural language over a WebSocket; the orchestrator answers and can perform write actions on confirmation.
2. **What problem is automated** — the business outcome (e.g. "self-service billing inquiries + disputes + recharges without an agent").
3. **The shape of the solution** — 1 MCP server (read tools), 1 A2A app (direct-Postgres action agents), 1 orchestrator, PostgreSQL-backed.

### Phase 2 — Discover operations (use AskUserQuestion), in this order
After the persona is set, ask only what changes the build — **persona → operations → read-vs-action → multi-step**:
1. **What operations does this persona perform?** Propose a default list for the domain+persona; let the user confirm/trim.
2. **Which are read-only lookups vs state-changing actions?** Read-only → **MCP tools**; state-changing → **A2A agents**. Propose the split.
3. **Which actions are multi-step agentic workflows** the orchestrator must chain across several agents/tools in one prompt (e.g. "full discharge = book appointment + order meds + free the bed + email summary")? These drive the orchestrator's routing system prompt and the full-workflow demo prompts.
4. **Action type per A2A agent** — default is a **direct PostgreSQL write** (`insert`/`update`) or **email**. Only ask about a REST-backend agent if the user brings it up; otherwise assume direct-Postgres (do NOT create a REST app — see the default-action hard rule).
5. **Email/notification agent?** → include one dedicated `send_confirmation_email` SMTP agent (creds from `config.md`); the reference use cases all have exactly one.
6. **LLM** — don't ask; take it from `config.md` (or the Phase 0 defaults: `gpt-5-nano`, empty base URL, temperature `0`) and state it in the plan. Ask only if the user mentions Azure OpenAI, a gateway, or another provider (then a real base URL is needed).
7. **Locale/persona details** → names, IDs, currency so demo data feels real (each reference use case has a flagship persona with a stable ID pattern, e.g. `MBR-100001`, `+1-415-555-0142`).
8. **Ports & folder** → default to a free port block and the Phase 0b output folder; confirm.

### Phase 3 — Present the plan / author the README, then GATE on approval  ⛔
Get explicit approval before building. Two equivalent ways depending on method preference:
- **README-first (recommended, esp. FDA mode):** write the **`README.md` before any database or app** — it is the approval artifact. Draft it to the reference-use-case shape: title + intro, the **persona**, an architecture overview (ASCII diagram), the **planned apps** with their **tools table** (name → table/query) and **agents table** (name → action type + workflow), the **database tables**, **sample prompts** (grouped MCP-only vs MCP+A2A, incl. the multi-step full-workflow prompt), **how the user will run it**, and **what will land in the manual-config gap section**.
- **Plan doc:** present the same content via `EnterPlanMode` → `ExitPlanMode`.

Then **STOP and get explicit user approval before creating any database or apps.** This is a hard gate — the single point where the user shapes the whole use case cheaply, before any `.flogo` exists. Include the confirmed **output folder** (Phase 0b) in what you present.

### Phase 4 — Build (only after approval; later steps depend on earlier names)
Build order is the same in both methods (`database.sql` → `reset_data.sql` → MCP → A2A → Orchestrator → finalize README + `prompts.md`), because later files depend on earlier names. **Follow 4A for FDA mode, 4B for clone mode.**

Shared step 1–2 (both methods):
1. `database.sql` — schema + **dummy/demo data** engineered per scenario (one clean case + one exception case per write-agent). Agent-written tables (disputes, tickets, orders, callbacks…) start empty. See [references/data-and-docs.md](references/data-and-docs.md).
2. `reset_data.sql` — same data, agent-written tables emptied, volatile dates relative to today.

#### Phase 4A — Build with `fda` (FDA mode)
3. `<Prefix>MCPServer.flogo` — build with `fda` per **[references/fda-build-recipes.md](references/fda-build-recipes.md) § MCP Server**. One read tool per lookup, each `act_postgresql_query` against a table/join; each tool handler MUST get input+output schemas (gotcha F1) or the MCP runtime panics.
4. `<Prefix>Agents.flogo` — build with `fda` per **§ A2A Agents**. One `tr_agent` trigger per agent; wire the tool handler with `--input toolParams:object --output response:object` + schemas. **Default action = write directly to PostgreSQL** (`act_postgresql_query` to validate → `act_postgresql_insert`) or `act_general_sendmail` for the email agent. **Do NOT build a REST-backend agent (`act_general_rest`) or a separate backend app unless the user explicitly asked** — if they did, use the opt-in REST steps in the recipe.
5. `<Prefix>AIOrchestrator.flogo` — build with `fda` per **§ Orchestrator**. Create the LLM/MCP/A2A connections, read their `conn://` UUIDs back from the file, then set `mcpServers` / `remoteAgents` arrays with `sa activity --jsonValue`. Apply the **three wsserver gotchas** (headers output schema; `wsconnection`/`content` = `any`; LLM base URL truly empty for OpenAI — never `New_value`).
6. **Finalize the README** (from Phase 3) + `prompts.md`: fill in real ports, exact start commands, and append the manual-config gap section (see [references/manual-config-gap.md](references/manual-config-gap.md)).

- **On Windows/Git-Bash, prefix `fda`/`flogobuild` with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`** (or drive `fda.exe` from a Python `subprocess`) so `/`-selectors and URLs aren't path-mangled.
- **Keep the drivers (replay) — never delete them.** Save them in `<UseCaseDir>/_rebuild/` (`build_mcp.py`, `build_a2a.py`, `build_orchestrator.py`), each with a 3-line header on how to re-run. Secrets are read **at run time** from env vars or `config.md` — never hardcoded — so `_rebuild/` can be committed (run the secret scan first). The driver must **refuse to write into a folder where its target `.flogo` already exists** (replay into a new/empty folder), and must never be used to "fix" an app opened in the designer (shared Hard rule).

#### Phase 4B — Build by cloning (clone mode)
3. `<Prefix>MCPServer.flogo` — one read tool per lookup. See [references/flogo-app-templates.md](references/flogo-app-templates.md).
4. `<Prefix>Agents.flogo` — one agent per write workflow. Use the INSERT/UPDATE param pattern from [references/postgres-activity-patterns.md](references/postgres-activity-patterns.md) exactly.
5. `<Prefix>AIOrchestrator.flogo` — WebSocket trigger + AI Agent activity wired to the MCP server connection and all A2A connections.
6. `README.md` + `prompts.md`.

**Fastest reliable method:** clone the JSON shape of an existing use-case app of the same type (e.g. `<reference-folder>/Telecom_Invoice_Chatbot_Use_Case/*.flogo`) and swap in the new domain's tables, tool/agent names, SQL, system prompts, ports, and **fresh** connection UUIDs. **Carry over the `contrib` base64 blobs and every `SECRET:` value verbatim** (clone-mode Hard rule). Only change the PostgreSQL `Database_Name` property to the new DB, and set the LLM values per Phase 0: `LLM_Model`, `AgenticAI.OpenAIConn.LLM_Base_URL` (a real `""` for OpenAI — never the text `New_value`), and `"temperature": 0` on every `#agent` trigger and the orchestrator `#agentactivity` (most reference apps still carry `0.7`).

**Token discipline (both methods, for the building agent — not user-facing):**
- Extract only the fields you need from a `.flogo` with a small `python -c "import json; …"` snippet (connection ids, one activity's settings) — don't Read whole `.flogo` files (they're 20–90 KB each).
- Read each reference doc once per build; don't re-read it for every app.
- Trim long command output (`| tail -n 20`, `| grep …`); don't dump `fda help` or full command output; don't echo whole files back after writing them.

### Phase 5 — Verify (do this before declaring done)
- **Data:** create/refresh a scratch DB, load `database.sql`, confirm row counts; confirm `reset_data.sql` reloads clean. Run the **exact** SQL from every MCP tool and every A2A query/insert against the DB (substitute demo values for `?params`) — this catches any table/column mismatch.
- **Static:** `python -m json.tool` (use `python3` on macOS/Linux) each `.flogo` (must parse); in FDA mode also `fda cm` each app. **Verify refs RESOLVE, don't just eyeball their format** — for every `input.Connection` and every orchestrator `mcpServers`/`remoteAgents` entry, confirm the `conn://<uuid>` matches an `id` in that file's `connections` map **and that the matched connection is the intended one by name** (every PostgreSQL activity → `PostgresConn`; a ref that resolves to `OpenAIConn` passes the "resolves" test but is wrong — gotcha F5). Confirm the orchestrator's MCP/A2A `serverUrl`s match the MCP/A2A ports, and `metadata.endpoints` ports match trigger ports and property values.
- **Don't-corrupt checks** on every `.flogo`: `grep -c New_value <dir>/*.flogo` must be **0** in every file; `grep -o '"temperature": *[^,}]*' <dir>/*.flogo` must show only `0` on every `#agent`/`tr_agent` and the orchestrator agent activity (FDA writes it as the string `"0"` — accept `"0"` or `0`; clone mode should be the number `0`, not `"0"`, not `0.7`).
- **Run the mapping/secret validation gate** on every `.flogo` you wrote or edited: **`python references/validate_flogo_apps.py <App1.flogo> <App2.flogo> …`** (checker shared by both methods — no app/column names baked in). It flags PostgreSQL mapping-mode hybrids (the `Fields[].Value` flag disagreeing with the mapping/schema container — both values-mode and parameters-mode are valid), unmapped `?placeholders`, `?placeholders` the connector won't substitute (`?p5::date` → designer `syntax error at or near "$5p5"` **and** a runtime failure; write `CAST(?p5 AS date)`), empty `Fields` on writes, `State`↔`Query` desync, missing `toolParams` flow-input schemas, and password-typed fields (`#sendmail`/`act_general_sendmail` Password) whose bound property isn't a `SECRET:` value. **Fix everything it prints before declaring done.** Details in [references/postgres-activity-patterns.md](references/postgres-activity-patterns.md) → "Validation gate".
- **Connector prerequisites** — run the read-only detection grep from [references/connector-prereqs.md](references/connector-prereqs.md) over the use-case folder (PostgreSQL always hits) and name every detected connector in the hand-off and the README.
- **Build (only if the user explicitly asks — shared Hard rule):** in FDA mode `flogobuild build-exe -f <app>.flogo -c <FLOGOBUILD_CONTEXT_NAME>` for each app, in the foreground (note the cosmetic exit-1 path bug — the `.exe` is still produced; verify by timestamp/size). Do **not** build proactively.
- **Live run (if requested):** start MCP → A2A → Orchestrator, then send a WebSocket prompt and confirm the LLM calls an MCP tool that returns real DB rows and the answer is written back.
- **End with an explicit hand-off.** Say what was verified vs. what still needs a Flogo import + live run, then list **everything the user must configure to run end to end** (the generated README carries the same list — FDA mode uses [references/manual-config-gap.md](references/manual-config-gap.md), trimmed to this use case):
  1. **OpenAI/LLM API key** (`API_Key`) — the only required LLM value; confirm the model (default `gpt-5-nano`) is available to that key; the base URL stays empty unless Azure OpenAI / a gateway / another provider. *(RAG apps: `OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT_URL` stays `https://api.openai.com/v1`; run the ingestion app first.)*
  2. **Connector prerequisites** — VS Code **Flogo** sidebar → **Help And Feedback** → **Install Prerequisites for Flogo Connectors…** for each detected connector, then reload VS Code (required for design-time metadata fetching).
  3. **PostgreSQL** — create the DB, load `database.sql`, set Host/Port/Database/User/Password.
  4. **SMTP** (if an email agent exists) — `Email_Username`, app password, and the `To_Email` recipient. **Re-enter `Email_App_Password` in the designer's App Properties so it's stored as a `SECRET:` value; leave its type `string`** (there is no `password` app-property type — see gotcha S6).
  5. **Ports** free; the orchestrator's MCP/A2A URLs match the MCP/A2A ports.
  6. **In the designer** — open each connection and click **Connect/Test**; re-enter secrets (the repo holds dummy `SECRET:` blobs / placeholders). **FDA mode:** also **Sync every trigger** (`tr_mcpserver`/`tr_agent`/`tr_wsserver` are non-OpenAPI — see [references/fda-limitations.md](references/fda-limitations.md)).
  7. **Start order MCP → A2A → Orchestrator**, then test in the chatbot (step list below).
  8. **At deploy** — inject secrets as platform app properties.

  **Finish the hand-off with "Test it in the chatbot"** from [references/chatbot-test.md](references/chatbot-test.md), filled in with this use case's real `ws://localhost:<port>/<path>`. It covers where the client lives (`samples/Agentic_AI/Chatbot`), `npm install` / `npm start`, http://localhost:3000, and the step people miss: **click the ↻ icon next to the URL box before Connect**. Put the same steps in the generated README.

  Also tell them: all chat clients share **one** conversation memory (the orchestrator's `conversationId` is empty → a constant) — up to `memoryMaxSize` messages until the app restarts, so restart the orchestrator between demos, and simultaneous users see each other's context. And repeat the shared Hard rules: never regenerate/re-clone a `.flogo` once it's been opened/edited in the designer (patch surgically), and never patch one that's open (Discard + close first).

## Key facts (verified across the reference use cases + a full FDA-only rebuild + live run)

- `appModel`: `1.1.1`; `metadata.flogoVersion`: match the reference apps / installed version (`2.26.5` on the reference set).
- **MCP Server** — trigger `#mcpserver` / `tr_mcpserver` (serverType `HTTP`, `serverPort` from a property, `serverEndpointPath` e.g. `/<usecase>mcpserver`, `serverName`/`serverVersion`). Each tool = a handler → a flow of `#query (act_postgresql_query) → #actreturn (act_default_actreturn)`. Read pattern: `SELECT * FROM public.<table> ORDER BY <pk> ASC;` (no params; the LLM filters rows). Return `=coerce.toString($activity[PostgreSQLQuery].Output)`. Tool descriptions must be rich — the LLM chooses tools from them. Set `readOnlyToolHint: true`.
- **A2A Agents** — one `#agent` / `tr_agent` trigger per agent, each with its own `agentName`, `agentDescription`, `agentType "A2A Server"`, `systemPrompt`, `agentPort`/`agentUrl` (properties), `model` (property), `temperature`/`memoryMaxSize` (number), `enableGuardrails`/`redactSensitiveData` (boolean), `conversationStoreType`, and a handler with `agentToolName` + `agentToolDescription` (wired `--input toolParams:object --output response:object` + schemas). **Default action flow (direct Postgres):** `noop → log → query (validate) → insert (INSERT/UPDATE) → log → actreturn`. Email agent: `noop → sendmail → log → actreturn` (Gmail SSL:465, recipient from a property).
- **Orchestrator** — trigger `#wsserver` / `tr_wsserver` (port from property; handler `path /<usecase>`, `mode Data`, `format String`) → flow `#agentactivity (act_agenticai_agentactivity) → #wswritedata (act_websocket_wswritedata)`. The agent activity lists the MCP connection under `mcpServers` and all A2A connections under `remoteAgents` (set via `sa activity --jsonValue`), with a `systemPrompt` holding the intent-routing rules. `input.userPrompt = =coerce.toString($flow.content)`; `wswritedata.input.message = =$activity[AIAgent].response`, `.wsconnection = =$flow.wsconnection`.
- **Connections per app**: MCP → 1 PostgreSQL (`#connection`/`con_postgresql`). A2A → 1 OpenAI (`#llmprovider`/`con_llmprovider`) + 1 PostgreSQL. Orchestrator → 1 OpenAI + 1 `#mcpserverconfig`/`con_mcpserverconfig` (serverType `http`, `httpTransportType streamable`, `serverUrl` = MCP URL) + one `#a2aserverconnection`/`con_a2aserverconnection` per A2A agent (`serverUrl` = that agent's URL). UUIDs must be unique within an app; every `conn://<uuid>` must match a `connections` map key.
- **Ports**: give each app/agent a distinct port (all from app properties); the orchestrator's MCP/A2A `serverUrl`s must point at the MCP/A2A ports; keep `metadata.endpoints` in sync with trigger ports and port properties.
- **Secrets & endpoints**: LLM API key, PostgreSQL password, SMTP app-password come from `config.md` and are stored as app properties (mark true secrets `SECRET:` where supported; in clone mode reuse encoded values verbatim). The LLM **base URL is empty for OpenAI** (the connector uses the OpenAI default — verified end-to-end); a real URL only for Azure OpenAI, a gateway/proxy, or another provider. RAG exception: the OpenAI vector extension's `OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT_URL` must stay `https://api.openai.com/v1` (its code rejects empty).
- **LLM defaults** (when `config.md` doesn't set them): `LLM_Model` = `gpt-5-nano`, `LLM_Base_URL` = `""`, `temperature` = `0` — gpt-5 reasoning models ignore temperature (connector sends 1.0, the only value they accept); 0 makes non-reasoning models deterministic.

Agentic type IDs used by `fda` (FDA mode):

| Component | Trigger ref | Activity refs | Connection refs |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCP Server | `tr_mcpserver` | `act_postgresql_query`, `act_default_actreturn` | `con_postgresql` |
| A2A Agents | `tr_agent` (one per agent) | `act_postgresql_query`, `act_postgresql_insert`, `act_general_sendmail`, `act_general_log`, `act_default_actreturn`, `act_default_noop` · *(opt-in only: `act_general_rest`)* | `con_llmprovider`, `con_postgresql` |
| Orchestrator | `tr_wsserver` | `act_agenticai_agentactivity`, `act_websocket_wswritedata` | `con_llmprovider`, `con_mcpserverconfig`, `con_a2aserverconnection` (one per A2A agent) |

## Top gotchas — SHARED (both methods)

1. **PostgreSQL mapping mode — the #1 error is a HYBRID, not a "wrong mode".** A write activity is valid in **either** mode, and `Fields[].Value` is the authoritative signal: **values-mode** (`Value:true` — mapping under `input.mapping.values[0]`, schema under `values.items.properties`; placeholder names = columns) OR **parameters-mode** (`Value:false, Parameter:true` — mapping under `input.mapping.parameters`, schema under `parameters.properties`; suffix placeholder names so they ≠ columns, e.g. `?customer_id1`). What breaks (red ✗ / "mappings vanished") is a **hybrid** where the `Fields[].Value` flag points at one container but the mapping/schema live in the other. **Read `Fields[].Value` first, then make both containers agree with it.** Templates + validator in [references/postgres-activity-patterns.md](references/postgres-activity-patterns.md).
2. **`?param` placeholder rule.** Always `?param` + `Fields[].Parameter:true` + `input.mapping.parameters` (never `RuntimeQuery`). **A `?param` must be followed by a space or one of `; ) , < > + - * % /`**, or the connector leaves it unsubstituted — the designer fails with `syntax error at or near "$5p5"` and the runtime fails too. So **never `?p::date`**: write `CAST(?p AS date)` (or `NULLIF(?p,'')::date`), and `?a || ?b`, not `?a||?b`. A local `psql` test won't catch it; the Phase 5 validator does.
3. **A2A param wiring is a 3-part contract, not one mapping.** The runtime mapping (`input.input.mapping.parameters`) is the ONLY part the engine uses; the flow-input `toolParams` schema (`metadata.input[toolParams].schema`) and the activity-input schema (`schemas.input.input`) are design-time only. Make the runtime mapping RUN (fixes `missing substitution for: <name>`); then click the trigger **Sync** on each agent flow to regenerate the two design-time schemas and clear red ✗. Patching one or two of the three is the classic half-fix. *(FDA recipes wire all three; the Sync fallback still applies — see gotcha F6.)* See [references/postgres-activity-patterns.md](references/postgres-activity-patterns.md) → "The 3-part designer contract".
4. **Derive NOT-NULL FKs the prompt won't carry.** For a write into a table whose owner/account/FK column the user never types, derive it in SQL via `INSERT … SELECT … COALESCE(NULLIF(?fk,''), parent.<fk>) FROM <parent> WHERE <key>=?p1` — don't map it from `toolParams` (the LLM sends null → not-null violation, and the agent stalls asking for an id the user doesn't know). Keep the `?placeholder` set unchanged so it's a query-text-only patch (no Sync). Section D of postgres-activity-patterns.md.
5. **Orchestrator system prompt must be honest and ordered:** never ask for internal/FK ids (agents derive them); call the email/notify agent only AFTER a write succeeds; never confirm or email a failed/skipped action; honor conditional ("if X, do Y") requests literally by reading X first. See [references/flogo-app-templates.md](references/flogo-app-templates.md) §3.
6. **Return/response building** — assemble the tool/agent reply `data` with `string.concat(...)` and `coerce.toString($activity[...].Output)`.
7. **Keep table/column names identical** across `database.sql`, MCP queries, and A2A queries — verify by running the actual SQL against a loaded DB.
8. **Port app properties must match the trigger field's type.** `tr_mcpserver` "HTTP Server Port" and `tr_agent` "A2A Server Port" fields are typed **string** — bind them to **`string`** app properties, or the designer flags *"Type of field … differs from the bound app property (number)"*. But `tr_wsserver` "port" and the PostgreSQL connection "Port" are **numeric** — keep `WebSocket_PORT` and `PostgreSQL.PostgresConn.Port` as **`number`**. Don't over-correct in either direction.
9. **Security cleanup / scrubbing secrets must NOT corrupt the app or break the designer.** Never neutralize a secret by writing `SECRET:YOURKEY` (or any `SECRET:<not-real-ciphertext>`): on load the designer AES-decrypts everything after the `SECRET:` prefix and fails → *"Can't render this application… An error occurred while attempting to decrypt secrets."* To remove a credential **and** keep the app renderable, **drop the `SECRET:` prefix entirely** and use a plain-string placeholder (the ones SECURITY.md sanctions): OpenAI key → `sk-REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-OPENAI-KEY`; Anthropic key → `sk-ant-REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-ANTHROPIC-KEY`; DB password → `SET_YOUR_DB_PASSWORD`; email app-password → `SET_YOUR_EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`; token/secret → `SET_YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` / `SET_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` / `SET_YOUR_JWT_SECRET`. These live in top-level app `properties` (`"value"`, keyed by the sibling `name`) or inline in connection settings under `apiKey`/`authToken`. Scrubbing has no `fda` subcommand, so make **surgical text edits only** — **never round-trip the file through a JSON formatter / `json.dump`** (it reflows/reorders the whole file → huge diff + broken import), and never regenerate the app (Hard rules). After editing, confirm every touched file parses (`python -m json.tool`) and grep that **no `SECRET:` prefix remains on a placeholder — except a password-typed field** (next gotcha). If the app is open in the designer, its **Sync rewrites the original encrypted blob back over your scrub** — have the user Discard + close the tabs first, then scrub, then reload. (A real `SECRET:<blob>` that still decrypts with Flogo's default key renders fine but is a reversible credential — scrub it the same way.)
10. **Password-typed field exception (`#sendmail`/`act_general_sendmail` Password / `Email_App_Password`): do NOT use the plain `SET_YOUR_EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` placeholder.** The designer derives `dataType=password` from the value's leading `SECRET:` prefix (NOT the JSON `type`, which stays `string`), so a plain string makes it infer `dataType=string` → `wrongTypeProp` ("mappings vanished"). Instead scrub it to a **designer-produced dummy `SECRET:` blob** — it keeps `dataType=password`, renders, and (decrypting to a dummy under Flogo's shared default `DATA_SECRET_KEY_DEFAULT`) leaks nothing. This is the one place a `SECRET:` prefix legitimately survives a scrub. **Never fabricate a `SECRET:` blob from scratch** (random ciphertext fails to decrypt → won't render), and **never force `"type":"password"`** on the property (invalid type → designer silently drops the property on save → hard error *"'Password' is bound to app property … which does not exist"*). Correct end state (matches the working Hospital app): binding kept, `type:string`, `value:"SECRET:…"`. See [references/postgres-activity-patterns.md](references/postgres-activity-patterns.md) § E and [references/fda-limitations.md](references/fda-limitations.md).

## Top gotchas — FDA MODE ONLY (each caused a distinct real failure; the recipes bake in the fixes)

- **F1. MCP tool handlers need input AND output schemas or the MCP runtime panics** (`missing input schema`). For every tool: `fda cs <Args> '{"type":"object","properties":{}}'` and `fda cs <Resp> '{"type":"object","properties":{"data":{"type":"string"},"error":{"type":"string"}}}'`, then `fda sa handler "<Trig>.<flow>.schemas.output.arguments" <Args> -C schema --force` and `… .schemas.reply.response <Resp> -C schema --force`. (`tr_agent` handlers likewise need `toolParams`/`response` schemas.)
- **F2. `actreturn` object mapping needs the `.mapping` node:** map `<flow>.Return.input.mappings.response.mapping.data`, NOT `…response.data`.
- **F2b. (Opt-in — REST backends only) REST activity `responseBody` must be declared as an output schema, or downstream mappings break.** *Applies only when the user explicitly asked for a REST-backend agent.* `act_general_rest` always exposes `statusCode`/`responseTimeInMillis`/`headers`, but **`responseBody` only exists if you set `schemas.output.responseBody`**. Fix: `fda sa activity "<flow>.InvokeRESTService.schemas.output.responseBody" --jsonFile <file> --force` with a draft-04 schema of the response fields. Do it for every REST activity whose body is consumed downstream.
- **F3. `conn://` arrays ARE automatable — not a manual step.** After `fda cc`, read the connection UUIDs back from the `.flogo`, then `fda sa activity "<flow>.AIAgent.settings.mcpServers" --jsonValue '["conn://<uuid>"]'` and `…remoteAgents --jsonValue '["conn://<a2a-uuid>",…]'`.
- **F4. wsserver orchestrator — three fixes (all required for a working WS reply):**
  - **Handler needs `schemas.output` present** or the wsserver trigger nil-panics on the first request. Attach the standard WS headers output schema: `fda cs <WsHeaders> '<headers schema>'` + `fda sa handler "<Trig>.<flow>.schemas.output.headers" <WsHeaders> -C schema --force`.
  - **`wth` converts type `any` → `object`** (only `params` survives). Typing `content`/`wsconnection` as `object` coerces the live WS connection into a plain map → `wswritedata: "Configured connection is not a WebSocket Connection"`. After `wth`, rewrite the whole array: `fda sa flow "<flow>.metadata.input" --jsonFile <file>` with `wsconnection` and `content` = `any`. (Per-element selectors do **not** mutate arrays — they add phantom keys.)
  - **LLM base URL: truly empty for OpenAI — never `New_value`.** `fda cap <prop> string ""` writes the literal text `New_value` → runtime posts to `/New_value/chat/completions` (`unsupported protocol scheme`). FDA-only way to a truly empty value (verified on FDA 0.9.3; only that property changes): `cap AgenticAI.OpenAIConn.LLM_Base_URL string placeholder`, find its index by name read-only, then `sa any properties.<index>.value --jsonValue '""'` (`sa property <dotted.name>.value` does NOT work — ambiguous). If `config.md` gives a non-empty URL, just `cap` it.
- **F5. PostgreSQL activities: bind the connection with `fda ca … -C PostgresConn` ONLY — never set `input.Connection` again with `fda sa activity`.** `ca -C <name>` writes the correct `conn://<uuid>` even when that connection is not first, and the binding survives every later `fda` write (verified on fda 0.9.3 by replaying the full A2A recipe with a readback after each step). A follow-up `fda sa activity "<flow>.<Act>.input.Connection" …` reports success but **rebinds to the FIRST connection in the file's `connections` map** — whether you pass the literal `conn://<uuid>`, the name with `-C connection`, `--force`, or `--jsonValue`. Position-dependent, so it hides in single-connection apps (MCP) and in apps whose DB connection is first, and bites the A2A app (`OpenAIConn` created first). **Verify** right after each `ca` with the recipe driver's `assert_conn()` and again in Phase 5 — the ref must resolve to the connection **named** `PostgresConn`. **Repair on an existing file:** patch the literal `conn://<current-uuid>` into that one field (a hand-set value survives later `fda` writes), or re-select in the designer — not `sa activity`. The id is **not stable across regeneration** (`fda cc` / re-entering DB creds mints a new UUID; old refs dangle → cleared to `""` on save), so once opened in the designer, never "fix" by regenerating — patch the field(s). See [references/fda-build-recipes.md](references/fda-build-recipes.md) § MCP step 4.
- **F6. A2A flow `toolParams` schema — `metadata.input` alone is NOT durable in the designer.** `wth --input toolParams:object` writes a **bare** `object` to `flow.metadata.input`, so the Input tab can't resolve `$flow.toolParams.<field>` (red ✗). Reusing the `<Agent>_ToolParams` JSON via `fda sa flow "<Agent>_flow.metadata.input" --jsonFile <file>` fixes the **runtime** schema (build/run correct) — but the designer treats `metadata.fe_metadata.input` (its cached view) as the **source of truth** and **regenerates `metadata.input` from it on save**; FDA never writes `fe_metadata`, so a CLI-only schema is **wiped back to a bare object the first time the user saves**. Make it stick via **one** of: **(a)** the user clicks **Sync** once on each trigger (writes both `metadata.input` and `fe_metadata`); or **(b)** at build time also **bake `fe_metadata.input`/`.output`** to the exact post-Sync shape (copy the format from an already-Synced flow — see the bake template in [references/fda-build-recipes.md](references/fda-build-recipes.md) § gotcha 5). Because all three triggers are non-OpenAPI, keep **"click Sync on every trigger"** as the manual-config-gap fallback regardless (see [references/fda-limitations.md](references/fda-limitations.md)). The app builds and runs correctly either way.
- **F7. App properties have no named value-setter** — only `cap` (create) and `rap` (remove). To change a value, `rap` then `cap`; connection/activity refs survive (they key by name). (`sa any properties.<index>.value --jsonValue …` is the one index-based setter — how F4 gets a truly empty base URL.) **`cap` type for numbers must be `number` (not `float64`)** — `float64` errors `Unknown Flogo Property Type`.
- **F8. Never configure a `password` app property through FDA — hand it to the user.** FDA app properties support only string / boolean / number; `password` is unsupported (`cap … password` errors `Unknown Flogo Property Type`; the assistant silently converts it to `string`), and `cap` writes plaintext (no `SECRET:` encryption). Create it as a `string` via FDA, then make it a manual-config-gap item — the user re-enters the value once in the designer's App Properties panel so it becomes `SECRET:…` (keep type `string`). Never force `"type":"password"` (see shared gotcha 10). Builds/runs as string either way; this only clears designer validation.
- **F9. Windows/Git-Bash:** prefix `fda`/`flogobuild` with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` (or drive `fda.exe` via Python `subprocess`) so URLs and `/`-selectors aren't mangled. Run builds in the foreground.

## Top gotchas — CLONE MODE ONLY

- **C1. Carry `contrib` + `SECRET:` verbatim; only change the DB name.** Regenerating `contrib` base64 blobs or `SECRET:` values by hand breaks import. Fresh, unique connection UUIDs per app; every `conn://<uuid>` must resolve to a `connections` map key in that app.
- **C2. Base URL: write a real `""`, never the literal `New_value`.** In clone mode you edit the JSON directly, so put a genuine empty string on `AgenticAI.OpenAIConn.LLM_Base_URL`'s `llmProviderUrl` for OpenAI (a real URL only for Azure/gateway/other). (The "must be a real endpoint" myth came from FDA's `cap … ""` writing `New_value` — not applicable when you edit JSON.)
- **C3. If any tool is exposed over REST/HTTP response instead of MCP, set `ConfigureHTTPResponse` body fields individually, never as one JSON blob.**
